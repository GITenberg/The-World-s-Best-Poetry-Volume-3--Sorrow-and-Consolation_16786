<h2><a name="AN_INTERPRETER_OF_LIFE"></a><a name="Page_ix"></a>AN INTERPRETER OF LIFE.</h2>

<p class="center"><strong>BY LYMAN ABBOTT.</strong></p>

<p>Poetry, music, and painting are three correlated arts, connected not
merely by an accidental classification, but by their intrinsic nature.
For they all possess the same essential function, namely, to interpret
the uninterpretable, to reveal the undiscoverable, to express the
inexpressible. They all attempt, in different forms and through
different languages, to translate the invisible and eternal into
sensuous forms, and through sensuous forms to produce in other souls
experiences akin to those in the soul of the translator, be he poet,
musician, or painter. That they are three correlated arts, attempting,
each in its own way and by its own language, to express the same
essential life, is indicated by their co-operation in the musical drama.
This is the principle which Wagner saw so clearly, and has used to such
effective purpose in his so-called operas, whose resemblance to the
Italian operas which preceded them is more superficial than real. In the
drama Wagner wishes you to consider neither the music apart from the
scenery, nor the scenery apart from the acting, nor the three apart from
the poetry. Poetry, music, and art combine with the actor to interpret
truths of life which transcend philosophic definition. Thus in the first
act <a name="Page_x"></a>of &quot;Parsifal,&quot; innocence born of ignorance, remorse born of the
experience of temptation and sin, and reverence bred in an atmosphere
not innocent yet free from the experience of great temptation, mingle in
a drama which elevates all hearts, because in some one of these three
phases it touches every heart. And yet certain of the clergy condemned
the presentation as irreverent, because it expresses reverence in a
symbolism to which they were unaccustomed.</p>

<p>But while it is true that these three arts are correlative and
co-operative, they do not duplicate one another. Each not only speaks in
a language of its own, but expresses in that language a life which the
others cannot express. As color and fragrance combine to make the
flower, but the color expresses what the fragrance cannot express, and
the fragrance expresses what the color cannot express, so in the musical
drama, music, poetry, and painting combine, not by duplicating but by
supplementing each other. One may describe in language a symphony; but
no description will produce the effect which the symphony produces. One
may describe a painting; but no description will produce the effect
which the painting will produce. So neither music, nor painting, nor
both combined, can produce the same effect on the soul as poetry. The
&quot;Midsummer Night's Dream&quot; enacted in pantomime, with Mendelssohn's
music, would no more produce the same effect on the auditors which would
be produced by the interpretation of the play in spoken words, than
would the reading of the play at home <a name="Page_xi"></a>produce the same effect as the
enacting of the play with what are miscalled the accessories of music
and scenery. The music and scenery are no more accessories to the words
than the words are accessories to the music and scenery. The three
combine in a triple language to express and produce one life, and it can
be expressed and produced in no other way than by the combination of the
three arts in harmonious action. This is the reason why no parlor
readings can ever take the place of the theatre, and no concert
performance can ever take the place of the opera. This is the reason why
all attempts to suppress the theatre and opera are and always will be in
vain. They are attempts to suppress the expression and awakening of a
life which can neither be expressed nor awakened in any other way; and
suppression of life, however successfully it may be accomplished for a
time, is never permanently possible.</p>

<p>These arts do not truly create, they interpret. Man is not a creator, he
is only a discoverer. The imagination is not creative, it is only
reportorial. Ideals are realities; imagination is seeing. The musician,
the artist, the poet, discover life which others have not discovered,
and each with his own instrument interprets that life to those less
sensitive than himself. Observe a musician composing. He writes; stops;
hesitates; meditates; perhaps hums softly to himself; perhaps goes to
the piano and strikes a chord or two. What is he doing? He is trying to
express to himself a beauty which he has heard in the world of infinite
phenomena, and to reproduce it as well as sensuous <a name="Page_xii"></a>sounds can reproduce
it, that those with duller hearing than himself may hear it also.
Observe a painter before his easel. He paints; looks to see the effect;
erases; adds; modifies; reexamines; and repeats this operation over and
over again. What is he doing? He is copying a beauty which he has seen
in the invisible world, and which he is attempting to bring out from its
hiding so that the men who have no eyes except for the sensuous may also
see it. In my library is an original sonnet by John G. Whittier. In
almost every line are erasures and interlineations. In some cases the
careful poet has written a new line and pasted it over the rejected one.
What does this mean? It means that he has discovered a truth of moral
beauty and is attempting to interpret his discovery to the world. His
first interpretation of his vision did not suit him, nor his second, nor
his third, and he has revised and re-revised in the attempt to make his
verse a true interpretation of the truth which he had seen. He did not
make the truth; it eternally was. Neither did the musician make the
truth of harmony, nor the painter the truth of form and color. They also
eternally were. Poet, musician, painter, have seen, heard, felt,
realized in their own souls some experience of life, some potent reality
which philosophy cannot formulate, nor creed contain, nor eloquence
define; and each in his own way endeavors to give it to the world of
men; each in his own way endeavors to lift the gauzy curtain,
impenetrable to most souls, which hides the invisible, the inaudible,
the eternal, the <a name="Page_xiii"></a>divine from men; and he gives them a glimpse of that of
which he himself had but a glimpse.</p>

<p>In one sense and in one only can art be called creative: the artist,
whether he be painter, musician, or poet, so interprets to other men the
experience which has been created in him by his vision of the
supersensible and eternal, that he evokes in them a similar experience.
He is a creator only as he conveys to others the life which has been
created in himself. As the electric wire creates light in the home; as
the band creates the movement in the machinery; thus and only thus does
the artist create life in those that wait upon him. He is in truth an
interpreter and transmitter, not a creator. Nor can he interpret what he
has not first received, nor transmit what he has not first experienced.
The music, the painting, the poem are merely the instruments which he
uses for that purpose. The life must first be in him or the so-called
music, painting, poem are but dead simulacra; imitations of art, not
real art. This is the reason why no mechanical device, be it never so
skillfully contrived, can ever take the place of the living artist. The
pianola can never rival the living performer; nor the orchestrion the
orchestra; nor the chromo the painting. No mechanical device has yet
been invented to produce poetry; even if some shrewd Yankee should
invent a printing machine which would pick out rhymes as some printing
machines seem to pick out letters, the result would not be a poem. This
is the reason too why mere perfection of execution never really
satisfies. &quot;She <a name="Page_xiv"></a>sings like a bird.&quot; Yes! and that is exactly the
difficulty with her. We want one who sings like a woman. The popular
criticism of the mere musical expert that he has no soul, is profound
and true. It is soul we want; for the piano, the organ, the violin, the
orchestra, are only instruments for the transmission of soul. This is
also the reason why the most flawless conductor is not always the best.
He must have a soul capable of reading the soul of the composer; and the
orchestra must receive the life of the composer as that is interpreted
to them through the life of the conductor, or the performance will be a
soulless performance.</p>

<p>Into each of these arts, therefore&mdash;music, painting, poetry&mdash;enter two
elements: the inner and the outer, the truth and the language, the
reality and the symbol, the life and the expression. Without the
electric current the carbon is a mere blank thread; the electric current
is not luminous if there be no carbon. The life and the form are alike
essential. So the painter must have something to express, but he must
also have skill to express it; the musician must have music in his soul,
but he must also have a power of instrumentation; the poet must feel the
truth, or he is no poet, but he must also have power to express what he

feels in such forms as will create a similar feeling in his readers, or
he is still no poet. Multitudes of women send to the newspapers poetical
effusions which are not poems. The feeling of the writer is excellent,
but the expression is bad. The writer has seen, but <a name="Page_xv"></a>she cannot tell what
she has seen; she has felt, but she cannot express her experience so as
to enkindle a like experience in others. These poetical utterances of
inarticulate poets are sometimes whimsical but oftener pathetic;
sometimes they are like the prattle of little children who exercise
their vocal organs before they have anything to say; but oftener they
seem to me like the beseeching eyes of a dumb animal, full of affection
and entreaty for which he has no vocal expression. It is just as
essential that poetical feeling should have poetical expression in order
to constitute poetry as it is that musical feeling should have musical
expression in order to constitute music. And, on the other hand, as
splashes of color without artistic feeling which they interpret are not
art, as musical, sounds without musical feeling which they interpret are
not music, so poetical forms without poetical feeling are not poetry.
Poetical feeling in unpoetical forms may be poetical prose, but it is
still prose. And on the other hand, rhymes, however musical they may be
to the ear, are only rhymes, not poetry, unless they express a true
poetical life.</p>

<p>But these two elements are separable only in thought, not in reality.
Poetry is not common thought expressed in an uncommon manner; it is not
an artificial phrasing of even the higher emotions. The higher emotions
have a phrasing of their own; they fall naturally&mdash;whether as the result
of instinct or of habit need not here be considered&mdash;into fitting forms.
The form may be rhyme; it may be blank verse; it may be the <a name="Page_xvi"></a>old Hebrew
parallelism; it may even be the indescribable form which Walt Whitman
has adopted. What is noticeable is the fact that poetical thought, if it
is at its best, always takes on, by a kind of necessity, some poetical
form. To illustrate if not to demonstrate this, it is only necessary to
select from literature any fine piece of poetical expression of a higher
and nobler emotion, or of clear and inspiring vision, and attempt to put
it into prose form. The reader will find, if he be dealing with the
highest poetry, that translating it into prose impairs its power to
express the feeling, and makes the expression not less but more
artificial. If he doubt this statement, let him turn to any of the finer
specimens of verse in this volume and see whether he can express the
life in prose as truly, as naturally, as effectively, as it is there
expressed in rhythmical form.</p>

<p>These various considerations may help to explain why in all ages of the
world the arts have been the handmaidens of religion. Not to amplify
too much, I have confined these considerations to the three arts of
music, painting, and poetry; but they are also applicable to sculpture
and architecture. All are attempts by men of vision to interpret to the
men who are not equally endowed with vision, what the invisible world
about us and within us has for the enrichment of our lives. This is
exactly the function of religion: to enrich human lives by making them
acquainted with the infinite. It is true that at times the arts have
been sensualized, the emphasis has been <a name="Page_xvii"></a>put on the form of expression,
not on the life expressed; and then reformers, like the Puritans and the
Quakers, have endeavored to exclude the arts from religion, lest they
should contaminate it. But the exclusion has been accomplished with
difficulty, and to maintain it has been impossible. It is neither an
accident, nor a sign of decadence, that painting and sculpture are
creeping back into the Protestant churches, to combine with poetry and
music in expressing the religious life of man. For the intellect alone
is inadequate either to express that life as it exists, or to call it
into existence where it does not exist. The tendency to ritual in our
time is a tendency not to substitute &aelig;sthetic for spiritual life, though
there is probably always a danger that such a substitution may be
unconsciously made, but to express a religious life which cannot be
expressed without the aid of &aelig;sthetic symbols. The work of the intellect
is to analyze and define. But the infinite is in the nature of the case
indefinable, and it is with the infinite religion has to do. All that
theology can hope to accomplish is to define certain provinces in the
illimitable realm of truth; to analyze certain experiences in a life
which transcends all complete analysis. The Church must learn to regard
not with disfavor or suspicion, but with eager acceptance, the
co-operation of the arts in the interpretation of infinite truth and the
expression of infinite life. Certainly we are not to turn our churches
into concert rooms or picture and sculpture galleries, and imagine that
&aelig;sthetic <a name="Page_xviii"></a>enjoyment is synonymous with piety. But as surely we are not to
banish the arts from our churches, and think that we are religious
because we are barren. All language, whether of painting, sculpture,
architecture, music, poetry, or oratory, is legitimately used to express
the divine life, as all the faculties, whether of painter, sculptor,
architect, musician, poet, orator, and philosopher, are to be used in
reaching after a more perfect knowledge of Him who always transcends and
always will transcend our perfect knowing.</p>

<p>Thus the study of poetry is the study of life, because poetry is the
interpretation of life. Poetry is not a mere instrument for promoting
enjoyment; it does not merely dazzle the imagination and excite the
emotions. Through the emotions and the imagination it both interprets
life and ministers to life. When the critic attempts to express that
truth, that is, to interpret the interpreter, which he can do only by
translating the poetry into prose, and the language of imagination and
emotion into that of philosophy, he destroys the poem in the process,
much as the botanist destroys the flower in analyzing it, or the musical
critic the composition in disentangling its interwoven melodies and
explaining the mature of its harmonic structure. The analysis, whether
of music, art, or poetry, must be followed by a synthesis, which, in the
nature of the case, can be accomplished only by the hearer or reader for
himself. All that I can do here is to illustrate this revelatory
character of poetry by some references <a name="Page_xix"></a>to the poems which this volume
contains. I do not attempt to explain the meaning of these poems; that is a task
quite impossible. I only attempt to show that they have a meaning, that
beneath their beauty of form is a depth of truth which philosophical
statement in prose cannot interpret, but the essence of which such
statement may serve to suggest. I do not wish to expound the truth of
life which is contained in the poet's verse; I only wish to show that
the poet by his verse reveals a truth of life which the critic cannot
express, and that it is for this reason pre-eminently that such a
collection of poetry as this is deserving of the reader's study.</p>

<p>If for example the student turns to such a volume as Newman Smyth's
&quot;Christian Ethics,&quot; he will find there a careful though condensed
discussion of the right and wrong of suicide. It is cool, deliberate,
philosophical. But it gives no slightest hint of the real state of the
man who is deliberating within himself whether he will commit suicide
or no; no hint of the real arguments that pass in shadow through his
mind:&mdash;the weariness of life which summons him to end all; the nameless,
indefinable dread of the mystery and darkness and night into which death
carries us, which makes him hesitate. If we would really understand the
mind of the suicide, not merely the mind of the philosopher coolly
debating suicide, we must turn to the poet.</p>

<div class="poem">
<p>&quot;To be, or not to be: that is the question:<br />
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer<br />
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,<br />
<a name="Page_xx"></a>Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,<br />
And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep;<br />
No more; and by a sleep to say we end<br />
The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks<br />
That flesh is heir to, 't is a consummation<br />
Devoutly to be wished. To die, to sleep;<br />
To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub;<br />
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come<br />
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,<br />
Must give us pause: there's the respect<br />
That makes calamity of so long life;<br />
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,<br />
The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,<br />
The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,<br />
The insolence of office, and the spurns<br />
That patient merit of the unworthy takes,<br />
When he himself might his quietus make<br />
With a bare bodkin! Who would fardels bear,<br />
To grunt and sweat under a weary life,<br />
But that the dread of something after death,<br />
The undiscovered country from whose bourne<br />
No traveller returns, puzzles the will<br />
And makes us rather bear those ills we have<br />
Than fly to others that we know not of?<br />
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;<br />
And thus the native hue of resolution<br />
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,<br />
And enterprises of great pith and moment<br />
With this regard their currents turn awry,<br />
And lose the name of action.&quot; </p>
</div>

<p>This first the poet does: he draws aside the veil which hides the
working of men's hearts, and lets us see their hidden life. But he does
more. Not merely does he afford us knowledge, he imparts life. For we
know feeling only by participating in the feeling; and the poet has the
art not merely to describe the experiences of men but so to describe
them that for the moment we share <a name="Page_xxi"></a>them, and so truly know them by the
only process by which they can be known. Who, for instance, can read
Thomas Hood's &quot;The Bridge of Sighs&quot; and not, as he reads, stand by the
despairing one as she waits a moment upon the bridge just ready to take
her last leap out of the cruelty of this world into, let us hope, the
mercy of a more merciful world beyond?</p>

<p><a name="Page_xxii"></a>No analysis of philosophy can make us acquainted with the tragedy of
this life as the poet can; no exhortation of preacher can so effectively
arouse in us the spirit of a Christian charity for the despairing
wanderer as the poet.</p>

<p>Would you know the tragedy of a careless and supercilious coquetry which
plays with the heart as the fisherman plays with the salmon? Read &quot;Clara
Vere de Vere.&quot; Would you know the dull heartache of a loveless married
life, growing at times into an intolerable anguish which no marital
fidelity can do much to medicate? Read &quot;Auld Robin Gray.&quot; Who but a poet
can interpret the pain of a parting between loving hearts, with its
remorseful recollections of the wholly innocent love's joys that are
past?</p>

<div class="poem"><p class="stanza">&quot;Had we never loved sae kindly,<br />
Had we never loved sae blindly,<br />
Never met&mdash;or never parted,<br />
We had ne'er been broken hearted.&quot;</p>
</div>

<p>Who but a poet can depict the perils of an unconscious drifting apart,
such as has destroyed many a friendship and wrecked many a married life,
as Clough has depicted it in &quot;Qua Cursum Ventus&quot;? If you would know the
life-long sorrow of the blind man at your side, would enter into his
life and for a brief moment share his captivity, read Milton's
interpretation of that sorrow in Samson's Lament. If you would find some
message to cheer the blind man in his darkness and illumine his
captivity, read the same poet's ode on his own blindness:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="stanza"><a name="Page_xxiii"></a><span class="i10">&quot;God doth not need,</span>
Either man's work, or his own gifts; who best<br />
Bear his mild yoke, they serve him best: his state<br />
Is kingly; thousands at his bidding speed,<br />
And post o'er land and ocean without rest;<br />
They also serve who only stand and wait.&quot;</p></div>

<p>No prison statistics, no police reports, no reformer's documents, no
public discussions of the question, What to do with the tramp, will ever
so make the student of life participant of the innermost experience of
the tramp, his experience of dull despair, his loss of his grip on life,
as B&eacute;ranger's &quot;The Old Vagabond.&quot; No expert in nervous diseases, no
psychological student of mental states, normal and abnormal, can give
the reader so clear an understanding of that deep and seemingly
causeless dejection, which because it seems to be causeless seems also
to be well-nigh incurable, as Percy Bysshe Shelley has given in his
&quot;Stanzas written near Naples.&quot; No critical expounder of the Stoical
philosophy can interpret the stoical temper which interposes a sullen
but dauntless pride to attacking sorrow as William Ernest Henley has
done:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="stanza">&quot;Out of the night that covers me,<br />
Black as the pit from pole to pole,<br />
I thank whatever gods may be<br />
For my unconquerable soul.</p>

<p class="stanza">&quot;In the fell clutch of circumstance<br />
I have not winced nor cried aloud.<br />
Under the bludgeonings of chance<br />
My head is bloody, but unbowed.&quot;</p></div>

<p>Nor can any preacher put in so vital a contrast to this despairing
defiance with which pride challenges <a name="Page_xxiv"></a>sorrow, the joyous victory which a
trusting love wins over it by submitting to it, as John Greenleaf
Whittier has done in &quot;The Eternal Goodness&quot;:</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="stanza">&quot;I know not what the future hath<br />
<span class="i2">Of marvel or surprise,</span>
Assured alone that life and death<br />
<span class="i2">His mercy underlies.</span></p>

<p class="stanza">&quot;I know not where His islands lift<br />
<span class="i2">Their fronded palms in air:</span>
I only know I cannot drift<br />
<span class="i2">Beyond His love and care.&quot;</span></p></div>

<p>No philosophical treatise can interpret bereavement as the great poets
have interpreted it. The mystery of sorrow, the bewilderment it causes,
the wonder whether there is any God or any good, the silence that is the
only answer to our call for help, the tumult of emotion, the strange
perplexity of mind, the dull despair, the inexplicable paralysis of
feeling, intermingling in one wholly inconsistent and incongruous
experience: where, in all the literature of Philosophy can we find such
an exposition and echo and interpretation of this experience as in that
great Hebrew epic&mdash;the Book of Job? And where in all the literature of
Philosophy can we find such interpreters of the two great comforters of the soul, faith and hope, as one finds in the poets? They do not argue;
they simply sing. And, as a note struck upon one of a chime of bells
will set the neighboring bell vibrating, so the strong note of faith and
hope sounded by the poet, sets a like note vibrating in the mourner's
heart. The mystery is not solved, <a name="Page_xxv"></a>but the silence is broken. First we
listen to the poet, then we listen to the same song sung in our own
hearts,&mdash;the same, for it is God who has sung to him and who sings to
us. And when the bereaved has found God, he has found light in his
darkness, peace in his tempest, a ray in his night.</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="stanza"><span class="i10">&quot;As a child,</span>
Whose song-bird seeks the wood forevermore,<br />
Is sung to in its stead by mother's mouth;<br />
Till, sinking on her breast, love-reconciled,<br />
He sleep the faster that he wept before.&quot;</p>
</div>

<p>The visitor to the island of Catalina, off the coast of California, is
invited to go out in a glass-bottomed boat upon the sea. If he accepts
the invitation and looks about him with careless curiosity, he will
enjoy the blue of the summer sky and ocean wave, and the architectural
beauty of the island hills; but if he turns his gaze downward and looks
through the glass bottom of the boat in which he is sailing, he will
discover manifold phases of beauty in the life beneath the sea waves: in
goldfish darting hither and thither, in umbrella-shaped jellyfish lazily
swimming by, in starfish and anemones of infinite variety, in
sea-urchins brilliant in color, and in an endless forest of water-weeds
exquisitely delicate in their structure. Perhaps he will try to
photograph them; but in vain: his camera will render him no report of
the wealth of life which he has seen. So he who takes up such a volume
of poetry as this will find ample repayment in the successive pictures
which it presents to his imagination, and <a name="Page_xxvi"></a>the transient emotions which
it will excite in him. But besides this there is a secret life which the
careless reader will fail to see, and which the critic cannot report,
but which will be revealed to the thoughtful, patient, meditative
student. In this power to reveal an otherwise unknown world, lies the
true glory of poetry. He that hath ears to hear, let him hear what the
poet has to say to him.</p>

You thought to break a country heart<br />
<span class="i2">For pastime, ere you went to town.</span>

<span class="i2">I saw the snare, and I retired:</span>
The daughter of a hundred Earls,<br />
<span class="i2">You are not one to be desired.</span>

You held your course without remorse,<br />
<span class="i2">To make him trust his modest worth,</span>
And, last, you fixed a vacant stare,<br />
<span class="i2">And slew him with your noble birth.</span>

Trust me, Clara Vere de Vere,<br />

In glowing health, with boundless wealth,<br />

Pray Heaven for a human heart,<br />

Of her own gentle voice afraid,<br />
So long had they in silence stood,<br />
Looking upon that moonlight flood,&mdash;<br />
&quot;How sweetly does the moonbeam smile<br />
To-night upon yon leafy isle!<br />
Oft in my fancy's wanderings,<br />
I've wished that little isle had wings,<br />
<a name="Page_7"></a>And we, within its fairy bowers,<br />

Would this be world enough for thee?&quot;&mdash;<br />
Playful she turned, that he might see<br />
<span class="i2">The passing smile her cheek put on;</span>

<span class="i2">His eyes met hers, that smile was gone;</span>
And, bursting into heartfelt tears,<br />

My dreams, have boded all too right,&mdash;<br />
We part&mdash;forever part&mdash;to-night!<br />
I knew, I knew it <i>could</i> not last,&mdash;<br />
'T was bright, 't was heavenly, but 't is past!<br />
O, ever thus, from childhood's hour,<br />
<span class="i2">I've seen my fondest hopes decay;</span>
I never loved a tree or flower<br />
<span class="i2">But 't was the first to fade away.</span>
I never nursed a dear gazelle,<br />
<span class="i2">To glad me with its soft black eye,</span>
But when it came to know me well,<br />
<span class="i2">And love me, it was sure to die!</span>
Now, too, the joy most like divine<br />
<span class="i2">Of all I ever dreamt or knew,</span>
To see thee, hear thee, call thee mine,&mdash;<br />

&quot;Oh, tell me, my God, what my heart doth betide,<br />
<span class="i10">Now the sun has gone down.&quot;</span>

<p class="stanza">
<span class="i2">VIOLA.&mdash;Ay, but I know,&mdash;</span>
<span class="i2">DUKE.&mdash;What dost thou know?</span>
<span class="i2">VIOLA.&mdash;Too well what love women to men may owe:</span>
<a name="Page_10"></a>In faith, they are as true of heart as we.<br />
My father had a daughter loved a man,<br />
As it might be, perhaps, were I a woman,<br />
I should your lordship.<br />
<span class="i2">DUKE.&mdash;And what's her history?</span>
<span class="i2">VIOLA.&mdash;A blank, my lord. She never told her love,</span>
But let concealment, like a worm i' the bud,<br />
Feed on her damask cheek; she pined in thought;<br />
And, with a green and yellow melancholy,<br />
She sat like Patience on a monument,<br />
Smiling at grief. Was not this love, indeed?<br />
We men may say more, swear more: but, indeed,<br />
Our shows are more than will; for still we prove<br />
Much in our vows, but little in our love.</p>

<p class="fullst">
O saw ye not fair Ines? she's gone into the west,<br />
To dazzle when the sun is down, and rob the world of rest;<br />
She took our daylight with her, the smiles that we love best,<br />
With morning blushes on her cheek, and pearls upon her breast.
</p>
<p class="fullst">O turn again, fair Ines, before the fall of night,<br />
For fear the moon should shine alone, and stars unrivalled bright;<br />
And bless&egrave;d will the lover be that walks beneath their light,<br />
<a name="Page_11"></a>And breathes the love against thy cheek I dare not even write!
</p>
<p class="fullst">Would I had been, fair Ines, that gallant cavalier<br />
Who rode so gayly by thy side and whispered thee so near!<br />
Were there no bonny dames at home, or no true lovers here,<br />
That he should cross the seas to win the dearest of the dear?
</p>
<p class="fullst">I saw thee, lovely Ines, descend along the shore,<br />
With bands of noble gentlemen, and banners waved before;<br />
And gentle youth and maidens gay, and snowy plumes they wore;&mdash;<br />
It would have been a beauteous dream&mdash;if it had been no more!
</p>
<p class="fullst">Alas! alas! fair Ines! she went away with song,<br />
With music waiting on her steps, and shoutings of the throng;<br />
But some were sad, and felt no mirth, but only Music's wrong,<br />
In sounds that sang Farewell, Farewell to her you've loved so long.
</p>
<p class="fullst">Farewell, farewell, fair Ines! that vessel never bore<br />
So fair a lady on its deck, nor danced so light before&mdash;<br />
Alas for pleasure on the sea, and sorrow on the shore!<br />
The smile that blest one lover's heart has broken many more!</p>

With how sad steps, O Moon! thou climb'st the skies,<br />
How silently, and with how wan a face!<br />
What may it be, that even in heavenly place<br />
That busy Archer his sharp arrows tries?<br />
Sure, if that long-with-love-acquainted eyes<br />
Can judge of love, thou feel'st a lover's case;<br />
I read it in thy looks; thy languished grace<br />
To me, that feel the like, thy state descries.<br />
Then, even of fellowship, O Moon, tell me,<br />
Is constant love deemed there but want of wit?<br />
Are beauties there as proud as here they be?<br />
Do they above love to be loved, and yet<br />
Those lovers scorn whom that love doth possess?<br />
Do they call virtue there ungratefulness?</p>

<p class="stanza">She wanders in the April woods,<br />
<span class="i2">That glisten with the fallen shower;</span>
She leans her face against the buds,<br />
<span class="i2">She stops, she stoops, she plucks a flower.</span>
<span class="i2">She feels the ferment of the hour:</span>
She broodeth when the ringdove broods;<br />
<span class="i2">The sun and flying clouds have power</span>
<a name="Page_14"></a>Upon her cheek and changing moods.<br />
<span class="i2">She cannot think she is alone,</span>
<span class="i4">As over her senses warmly steal</span>
<span class="i2">Floods of unrest she fears to own</span>
<span class="i4">And almost dreads to feel.</span>
</p><p class="stanza">
Among the summer woodlands wide<br />
<span class="i2">Anew she roams, no more alone;</span>
The joy she feared is at her side,<br />
<span class="i2">Spring's blushing secret now is known.</span>
<span class="i2">The primrose and its mates have flown,</span>
The thrush's ringing note hath died;<br />
<span class="i2">But glancing eye and glowing tone</span>
Fall on her from her god, her guide.<br />
<span class="i2">She knows not, asks not, what the goal,</span>

<span class="i2">And yields her pure unquestioning soul</span>
<span class="i4">To touch and fondling kiss.</span>
</p><p class="stanza">
And still she haunts those woodland ways,<br />
<span class="i2">Though all fond fancy finds there now</span>
To mind of spring or summer days,<br />
<span class="i2">Are sodden trunk and songless bough.</span>
<span class="i2">The past sits widowed on her brow,</span>
Homeward she wends with wintry gaze,<br />
<span class="i2">To walls that house a hollow vow,</span>
To hearth where love hath ceased to blaze;<br />
<span class="i2">Watches the clammy twilight wane,</span>
<span class="i4">With grief too fixed for woe or tear;</span>

<p class="title">THE SUN-DIAL.</p>

<p class="stanza">
'T is an old dial, dark with many a stain;<br />
<span class="i2">In summer crowned with drifting orchard bloom,</span>
Tricked in the autumn with the yellow rain,<br />
<span class="i2">And white in winter like a marble tomb.</span>
</p><p class="stanza">
And round about its gray, time-eaten brow<br />
<span class="i2">Lean letters speak,&mdash;a worn and shattered row:</span>
<b>I am a Shade; a Shadowe too art thou:</b><br />
<span class="i2"><b>I marke the Time: saye, Gossip, dost thou soe?</b></span>
</p><p class="stanza">
Here would the ring-doves linger, head to head;<br />
<span class="i2">And here the snail a silver course would run,</span>
Beating old Time; and here the peacock spread<br />
<span class="i2">His gold-green glory, shutting out the sun.</span>
</p><p class="stanza">
The tardy shade moved forward to the noon;<br />
<span class="i2">Betwixt the paths a dainty Beauty stept,</span>
That swung a flower, and, smiling hummed a tune,&mdash;<br />
<span class="i2">Before whose feet a barking spaniel leapt.</span>
</p><p class="stanza">
O'er her blue dress an endless blossom strayed;<br />
<span class="i2">About her tendril-curls the sunlight shone;</span>
And round her train the tiger-lilies swayed,<br />
<span class="i2">Like courtiers bowing till the queen be gone.</span>
</p><p class="stanza">
She leaned upon the slab a little while,<br />
<span class="i2">Then drew a jewelled pencil from her zone,</span>
Scribbled a something with a frolic smile,<br />
<span class="i2">Folded, inscribed, and niched it in the stone.</span>
</p><p class="stanza"><a name="Page_16"></a>
The shade slipped on, no swifter than the snail;<br />
<span class="i2">There came a second lady to the place,</span>
Dove-eyed, dove-robed, and something wan and pale,&mdash;<br />
<span class="i2">An inner beauty shining from her face.</span>
</p><p class="stanza">
She, as if listless with a lonely love,<br />
<span class="i2">Straying among the alleys with a book,&mdash;</span>
Herrick or Herbert,&mdash;watched the circling dove,<br />
<span class="i2">And spied the tiny letter in the nook.</span>
</p><p class="stanza">
Then, like to one who confirmation found<br />
<span class="i2">Of some dread secret half-accounted true,&mdash;</span>
Who knew what hearts and hands the letter bound,<br />
<span class="i2">And argued loving commerce 'twixt the two,&mdash;</span>
</p><p class="stanza">
She bent her fair young forehead on the stone;<br />
<span class="i2">The dark shade gloomed an instant on her head;</span>
And 'twixt her taper fingers pearled and shone<br />
<span class="i2">The single tear that tear-worn eyes will shed.</span>
</p><p class="stanza">
The shade slipped onward to the falling gloom;<br />
<span class="i2">Then came a soldier gallant in her stead,</span>
Swinging a beaver with a swaling plume,<br />
<span class="i2">A ribboned love-lock rippling from his head.</span>
</p><p class="stanza">
Blue-eyed, frank-faced, with clear and open brow,<br />
<span class="i2">Scar-seamed a little, as the women love;</span>
So kindly fronted that you marvelled how<br />
<span class="i2">The frequent sword-hilt had so frayed his glove;</span>
</p><p class="stanza"><a name="Page_17"></a>
Who switched at Psyche plunging in the sun;<br />
<span class="i2">Uncrowned three lilies with a backward swinge;</span>
And standing somewhat widely, like to one<br />
<span class="i2">More used to &quot;Boot and Saddle&quot; than to cringe</span>
</p><p class="stanza">
As courtiers do, but gentleman withal,<br />
<span class="i2">Took out the note;&mdash;held it as one who feared</span>
The fragile thing he held would slip and fall;<br />
<span class="i2">Read and re-read, pulling his tawny beard;</span>
</p><p class="stanza">
Kissed it, I think, and hid it in his breast;<br />
<span class="i2">Laughed softly in a flattered, happy way,</span>
Arranged the broidered baldrick on his crest,<br />
<span class="i2">And sauntered past, singing a roundelay.</span>
</p><p class="stanza">
<span class="i6">  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span>
</p><p class="stanza">
The shade crept forward through the dying glow;<br />
<span class="i2">There came no more nor dame nor cavalier;</span>
But for a little time the brass will show<br />
<span class="i2">A small gray spot,&mdash;the record of a tear.</span>

<div class="poem">
<p class="title">LOCKSLEY HALL.</p>

<p class="fullst">Comrades, leave me here a little, while as yet 'tis early morn,&mdash;<br />
Leave me here, and when you want me, sound upon the bugle horn.
</p>
<p class="fullst">'Tis the place, and all around it, as of old, the curlews call,<br />
Dreary gleams about the moorland, flying over Locksley Hall:
</p>
<p class="fullst"><a name="Page_18"></a>Locksley Hall, that in the distance overlooks the sandy tracts,<br />
And the hollow ocean-ridges roaring into cataracts.
</p>
<p class="fullst">Many a night from yonder ivied casement, ere I went to rest,<br />
Did I look on great Orion sloping slowly to the west.
</p>
<p class="fullst">Many a night I saw the Pleiads, rising through the mellow shade,<br />
Glitter like a swarm of fire-flies tangled in a silver braid.
</p>
<p class="fullst">Here about the beach I wandered, nourishing a youth sublime<br />
With the fairy tales of science, and the long result of time;
</p>
<p class="fullst">When the centuries behind me like a fruitful land reposed;<br />
When I clung to all the present for the promise that it closed;
</p>
<p class="fullst">When I dipt into the future far as human eye could see,&mdash;<br />
Saw the vision of the world, and all the wonder that would be.
</p>
<p class="fullst">In the spring a fuller crimson comes upon the robin's breast;<br />
In the spring the wanton lapwing gets himself another crest;
</p>
<p class="fullst"><a name="Page_19"></a>In the spring a livelier iris changes on the burnished dove;<br />
In the spring a young man's fancy lightly turns to thoughts of love.
</p>

<p class="fullst">Then her cheek was pale and thinner than should be for one so young,<br />
And her eyes on all my motions with a mute observance hung.
</p>
<p class="fullst">And I said, &quot;My cousin Amy, speak, and speak the truth to me;<br />
Trust me, cousin, all the current of my being sets to thee.&quot;
</p>
<p class="fullst">On her pallid cheek and forehead came a color and a light,<br />
As I have seen the rosy red flushing in the northern night.
</p>
<p class="fullst">And she turned,&mdash;her bosom shaken with a sudden storm of sighs;<br />
All the spirit deeply dawning in the dark of hazel eyes,&mdash;
</p>
<p class="fullst">Saying, &quot;I have hid my feelings, fearing they should do me wrong;&quot; <br/>
Saying, &quot;Dost thou love me, cousin?&quot; weeping, &quot;I have loved thee long.&quot;
</p>
<p class="fullst">Love took up the glass of time, and turned it in his glowing hands;<br />
Every moment, lightly shaken, ran itself in golden sands.
</p>
<p class="fullst"><a name="Page_20"></a>Love took up the harp of life, and smote on all the chords with might;<br />
Smote the chord of self, that, trembling, passed in music out of sight.
</p>
<p class="fullst">Many a morning on the moorland did we hear the copses ring,<br />
And her whisper thronged my pulses with the fulness of the spring.
</p>
<p class="fullst">Many an evening by the water did we watch the stately ships,<br />
And our spirits rushed together at the touching of the lips.
</p>
<p class="fullst">O my cousin, shallow-hearted! O my Amy, mine no more!<br />
O the dreary, dreary moorland! O the barren, barren shore!
</p>
<p class="fullst">Falser than all fancy fathoms, falser than all songs have sung,&mdash;<br />
Puppet to a father's threat, and servile to a shrewish tongue!
</p>
<p class="fullst">Is it well to wish thee happy?&mdash;having known me; to decline<br />
On a range of lower feelings and a narrower heart than mine!
</p>
<p class="fullst">Yet it shall be: thou shalt lower to his level day by day,<br />
What is fine within thee growing coarse to sympathize with clay.
</p>
<p class="fullst"><a name="Page_21"></a>As the husband is, the wife is; thou art mated with a clown,<br />
And the grossness of his nature will have weight to drag thee down.
</p>
<p class="fullst">He will hold thee, when his passion shall have spent its novel force,<br />
Something better than his dog, a little dearer than his horse.
</p>
<p class="fullst">What is this? his eyes are heavy,&mdash;think not they are glazed with wine.<br />
Go to him; it is thy duty,&mdash;kiss him; take his hand in thine.
</p>
<p class="fullst">It may be my lord is weary, that his brain is over wrought,&mdash;<br />
Soothe him with thy finer fancies, touch him with thy lighter thought.
</p>
<p class="fullst">He will answer to the purpose, easy things to understand,&mdash;<br />
Better thou wert dead before me, though I slew thee with my hand.
</p>
<p class="fullst">Better thou and I were lying, hidden from the heart's disgrace,<br />
Rolled in one another's arms, and silent in a last embrace.
</p>
<p class="fullst">Cursed be the social wants that sin against the strength of youth!<br />
Cursed be the social lies that warp us from the living truth!
</p>
<p class="fullst"><a name="Page_22"></a>Cursed be the sickly forms that err from honest nature's rule<br />
Cursed be the gold that gilds the straitened forehead of the fool!
</p>
<p class="fullst">Well&mdash;'t is well that I should bluster!&mdash;Hadst thou less unworthy proved,<br />
Would to God&mdash;for I had loved thee more than ever wife was loved.
</p>
<p class="fullst">Am I mad, that I should cherish that which bears but bitter fruit?<br />
 from my bosom, though my heart be at the root.
</p>
<p class="fullst">Never! though my mortal summers to such length of years should come<br />
As the many-wintered crow that leads the clanging rookery home.
</p>
<p class="fullst">Where is comfort? in division of the records of the mind?<br />
Can I part her from herself, and love her, as I knew her, kind?
</p>
<p class="fullst">I remember one that perished; sweetly did she speak and move;<br />
Such a one do I remember, whom to look at was to love.
</p>
<p class="fullst">Can I think of her as dead, and love her for the love she bore?<br />
No,&mdash;she never loved me truly; love is love forevermore.
</p>
<p class="fullst"><a name="Page_23"></a>Comfort? comfort scorned of devils; this is truth the poet sings,<br />
That a sorrow's crown of sorrow is remembering happier things.
</p>
<p class="fullst">Drug thy memories, lest thou learn it, lest thy heart be put to proof,<br />
In the dead, unhappy night, and when the rain is on the roof.
</p>
<p class="fullst">Like a dog, he hunts in dreams; and thou art staring at the wall,<br />
Where the dying night-lamp flickers, and the shadows rise and fall.
</p>
<p class="fullst">Then a hand shall pass before thee, pointing to his drunken sleep,<br />
To thy widowed marriage-pillows, to the tears that thou wilt weep.
</p>
<p class="fullst">Thou shalt hear the &quot;Never, never,&quot; whispered by the phantom years,<br />
And a song from out the distance in the ringing of thine ears;
</p>
<p class="fullst">And an eye shall vex thee, looking ancient kindness on thy pain.<br />
Turn thee, turn thee on thy pillow; get thee to thy rest again.
</p>
<p class="fullst">Nay, but nature brings thee solace; for a tender voice will cry;<br />
'Tis a purer life than thine, a lip to drain thy trouble dry.
</p>
<p class="fullst"><a name="Page_24"></a>Baby lips will laugh me down; my latest rival brings thee rest,&mdash;<br />
Baby fingers, waxen touches, press me from the mother's breast.
</p>
<p class="fullst">O, the child too clothes the father with a dearness not his due.<br />
Half is thine and half is his: it will be worthy of the two.
</p>
<p class="fullst">O, I see thee old and formal, fitted to thy petty part,<br />
With a little hoard of maxims preaching down a daughter's heart.
</p>
<p class="fullst">&quot;They were dangerous guides, the feelings&mdash;she herself was not exempt&mdash;<br />
Truly, she herself had suffered&quot;&mdash;Perish in thy self-contempt!
</p>
<p class="fullst">Overlive it&mdash;lower yet&mdash;be happy! wherefore should I care?<br />
I myself must mix with action, lest I wither by despair.
</p>
<p class="fullst">What is that which I should turn to, lighting upon days like these?<br />
Every door is barred with gold, and opens but to golden keys.
</p>
<p class="fullst">Every gate is thronged with suitors, all the markets overflow.<br />
I have but an angry fancy: what is that which I should do?
</p>
<p class="fullst"><a name="Page_25"></a>I had been content to perish, falling on the foeman's ground,<br />
When the ranks are rolled in vapor, and the winds are laid with sound.
</p>
<p class="fullst">But the jingling of the guinea helps the hurt that honor feels,<br />
And the nations do but murmur, snarling at each other's heels.
</p>
<p class="fullst">Can I but relive in sadness? I will turn that earlier page.<br />
Hide me from my deep emotion, O thou wondrous mother-age!
</p>
<p class="fullst">Make me feel the wild pulsation that I felt before the strife,<br />
When I heard my days before me, and the tumult of my life;
</p>
<p class="fullst">
Yearning for the large excitement that the coming years would yield,<br />
Eager-hearted as a boy when first he leaves his father's field,
</p>
<p class="fullst">And at night along the dusky highway near and nearer drawn,<br />
Sees in heaven the light of London flaring like a dreary dawn;
</p>
<p class="fullst">And his spirit leaps within him to be gone before him then,<br />
Underneath the light he looks at, in among the throngs of men;
</p>
<p class="fullst"><a name="Page_26"></a>Men, my brothers, men the workers, ever reaping something new:<br />
That which they have done but earnest of the things that they shall do:
</p>
<p class="fullst">For I dipt into the future, far as human eye could see,<br />
Saw the vision of the world, and all the wonder that would be;
</p>
<p class="fullst">Saw the heavens fill with commerce, argosies of magic sails,<br />
Pilots of the purple twilight, dropping down with costly bales;
</p>
<p class="fullst">Heard the heavens fill with shouting, and there rained a ghastly dew<br />
From the nations' airy navies grappling in the central blue;
</p>
<p class="fullst">Far along the world-wide whisper of the south-wind rushing warm,<br />
With the standards of the peoples plunging through the thunder-storm;
</p>
<p class="fullst">Till the war-drum throbbed no longer, and the battle flags were furled<br />
In the parliament of man, the federation of the world.
</p>
<p class="fullst">There the common sense of most shall hold a fretful realm in awe,<br />
And the kindly earth shall slumber, lapt in universal law.
</p>
<p class="fullst"><a name="Page_27"></a>So I triumphed ere my passion sweeping through me left me dry,<br />
Left me with a palsied heart, and left me with the jaundiced eye;
</p>
<p class="fullst">Eye, to which all order festers, all things here are out of joint.<br />
Science moves, but slowly, slowly, creeping on from point to point:
</p>
<p class="fullst">Slowly comes a hungry people, as a lion, creeping nigher,<br />
Glares at one that nods and winks behind a slowly dying fire.
</p>
<p class="fullst">Yet I doubt not through the ages one increasing purpose runs,<br />
And the thoughts of men are widened with the process of the suns.
</p>
<p class="fullst">What is that to him that reaps not harvest of his youthful joys,<br />
Though the deep heart of existence beat forever like a boy's?
</p>
<p class="fullst">Knowledge comes, but wisdom lingers; and I linger on the shore<br />
And the individual withers, and the world is more and more.
</p>
<p class="fullst">Knowledge comes, but wisdom lingers, and he bears a laden breast,<br />
Full of sad experience moving toward the stillness of his rest.
</p>
<p class="fullst"><a name="Page_28"></a>Hark! my merry comrades call me, sounding on the bugle horn,&mdash;<br />
They to whom my foolish passion were a target for their scorn;
</p>
<p class="fullst">Shall it not be scorn to me to harp on such a mouldered string?<br />
I am shamed through all my nature to have loved so slight a thing.
</p>
<p class="fullst">
Weakness to be wroth with weakness! woman's pleasure, woman's pain&mdash;<br />
Nature made them blinder motions bounded in a shallower brain;
</p>
<p class="fullst">Woman is the lesser man, and all thy passions, matched with mine,<br />
Are as moonlight unto sunlight, and as water unto wine&mdash;
</p>
<p class="fullst">Here at least, where nature sickens, nothing. Ah for some retreat<br />
Deep in yonder shining Orient, where my life began to beat!
</p>
<p class="fullst">Where in wild Mahratta-battle fell my father, evil-starred;<br />
I was left a trampled orphan, and a selfish uncle's ward.
</p>
<p class="fullst">Or to burst all links of habit,&mdash;there to wander far away,<br />
On from island unto island at the gateways of the day,
</p>
<p class="fullst"><a name="Page_29"></a>Larger constellations burning, mellow moons and happy skies,<br />
Breadths of tropic shade and palms in cluster, knots of Paradise.
</p>
<p class="fullst">Never comes the trader, never floats an European flag,&mdash;<br />

Summer isles of Eden lying in dark-purple spheres of sea.

<p class="fullst">There, methinks, would be enjoyment more than in this march of mind&mdash;<br />
In the steamship, in the railway, in the thoughts that shake mankind.

<p class="fullst">There the passions, cramped no longer, shall have scope and breathing-space;<br />
I will take some savage woman, she shall rear my dusky race.

Catch the wild goat by the hair, and hurl their lances in the sun,

Not with blinded eyesight poring over miserable books&mdash;

Like a beast with lower pleasures, like a beast with lower pains!
</p>
<p class="fullst">Mated with a squalid savage,&mdash;what to me were sun or clime?<br />
I, the heir of all the ages, in the foremost files of time,&mdash;

Than that earth should stand at gaze like Joshua's moon in Ajalon!
</p>
<p class="fullst">Not in vain the distance beacons. Forward, forward let us range;<br />
Let the great world spin forever down the ringing grooves of change.
</p>
<p class="fullst">Through the shadow of the globe we sweep into the younger day:<br />
Better fifty years of Europe than a cycle of Cathay.
</p>
<p class="fullst">Mother-age, (for mine I knew not,) help me as when life begun,&mdash;<br />
Rift the hills and roll the waters, flash the lightnings, weigh the sun,
</p>
<p class="fullst"><a name="Page_31"></a>O, I see the crescent promise of my spirit hath not set;<br />
Ancient founts of inspiration well through all my fancy yet.
</p>
<p class="fullst">Howsoever these things be, a long farewell to Locksley Hall!<br />
Now for me the woods may wither, now for me the roof-tree fall.
</p>
<p class="fullst">Comes a vapor from the margin, blackening over heath and holt,<br />
Cramming all the blast before it, in its breast a thunderbolt.
</p>
<p class="fullst">Let it fall on Locksley Hall, with rain or hail, or fire or snow;<br />
For the mighty wind arises, roaring seaward, and I go.</p>

<p class="title"><a name="Page_35"></a><a name="MAUD_MULLER"></a>MAUD MULLER.</p>

<p class="stanza">Maud Muller, on a summer's day,<br />
Raked the meadow sweet with hay.</p>

<p class="stanza">Beneath her torn hat glowed the wealth<br />
Of simple beauty and rustic health.</p>

<p class="stanza">Singing, she wrought, and her merry glee<br />
The mock-bird echoed from his tree.</p>

<p class="stanza">But, when she glanced to the far-off town,<br />
White from its hill-slope looking down,</p>

<p class="stanza">The sweet song died, and a vague unrest<br />
And a nameless longing filled her breast,&mdash;</p>

<p class="stanza">A wish, that she hardly dared to own,<br />
For something better than she had known.</p>

<p class="stanza">The Judge rode slowly down the lane,<br />
Smoothing his horse's chestnut mane.</p>

<p class="stanza">He drew his bridle in the shade<br />
Of the apple-trees, to greet the maid,</p>

<p class="stanza">And ask a draught from the spring that flowed<br />
Through the meadow, across the road.</p>

<p class="stanza">She stooped where the cool spring bubbled up,<br />
And filled for him her small tin cup,</p>

<p class="stanza"><a name="Page_36"></a>And blushed as she gave it, looking down<br />
On her feet so bare, and her tattered gown.</p>

<p class="stanza">&quot;Thanks!&quot; said the Judge, &quot;a sweeter draught<br />
From a fairer hand was never quaffed.&quot;</p>

<p class="stanza">He spoke of the grass and flowers and trees,<br />
Of the singing birds and the humming bees;</p>

<p class="stanza">Then talked of the haying, and wondered whether<br />
The cloud in the west would bring foul weather.</p>

<p class="stanza">And Maud forgot her brier-torn gown,<br />
And her graceful ankles, bare and brown,</p>

<p class="stanza">And listened, while a pleased surprise<br />
Looked from her long-lashed hazel eyes.</p>

<p class="stanza">At last, like one who for delay<br />
Seeks a vain excuse, he rode away.</p>

<p class="stanza">Maud Muller looked and sighed: &quot;Ah me!<br />
That I the Judge's bride might be!</p>

<p class="stanza">&quot;He would dress me up in silks so fine,<br />
And praise and toast me at his wine.</p>

<p class="stanza">&quot;My father should wear a broadcloth coat,<br />
My brother should sail a painted boat.</p>

<p class="stanza">&quot;I 'd dress my mother so grand and gay,<br />
And the baby should have a new toy each day.</p>

<p class="stanza">&quot;And I'd feed the hungry and clothe the poor,<br />
And all should bless me who left our door.&quot;</p>

<p class="stanza"><a name="Page_37"></a>The Judge looked back as he climbed the hill,<br />
And saw Maud Muller standing still:</p>

<p class="stanza">&quot;A form more fair, a face more sweet,<br />
Ne'er hath it been my lot to meet.</p>

<p class="stanza">&quot;And her modest answer and graceful air<br />
Show her wise and good as she is fair.</p>

<p class="stanza">&quot;Would she were mine, and I to-day,<br />
Like her, a harvester of hay.</p>

<p class="stanza">&quot;No doubtful balance of rights and wrongs,<br />
Nor weary lawyers with endless tongues,</p>

<p class="stanza">&quot;But low of cattle, and song of birds,<br />
And health, and quiet, and loving words.&quot;</p>

<p class="stanza">But he thought of his sister, proud and cold,<br />
And his mother, vain of her rank and gold.</p>

<p class="stanza">So, closing his heart, the Judge rode on,<br />
And Maud was left in the field alone.</p>

<p class="stanza">But the lawyers smiled that afternoon,<br />
When he hummed in court an old love tune;</p>

<p class="stanza">And the young girl mused beside the well,<br />
Till the rain on the unraked clover fell.</p>

<p class="stanza">He wedded a wife of richest dower,<br />
Who lived for fashion, as he for power.</p>

<p class="stanza"><a name="Page_38"></a>Yet oft, in his marble hearth's bright glow,<br />
He watched a picture come and go;</p>

<p class="stanza">And sweet Maud Muller's hazel eyes<br />
Looked out in their innocent surprise.</p>

<p class="stanza">Oft, when the wine in his glass was red,<br />
He longed for the wayside well instead,</p>

<p class="stanza">And closed his eyes on his garnished rooms,<br />
To dream of meadows and clover blooms;</p>

<p class="stanza">And the proud man sighed with a secret pain,<br />
&quot;Ah, that I were free again!</p>

<p class="stanza">&quot;Free as when I rode that day<br />
Where the barefoot maiden raked the hay.&quot;</p>

<p class="stanza">She wedded a man unlearned and poor,<br />
And many children played round her door.</p>

<p class="stanza">But care and sorrow, and child-birth pain,<br />
Left their traces on heart and brain.</p>

<p class="stanza">And oft, when the summer sun shone hot<br />
On the new-mown hay in the meadow lot,</p>

<p class="stanza">And she heard the little spring brook fall<br />
Over the roadside, through the wall,</p>

<p class="stanza">In the shade of the apple-tree again<br />
She saw a rider draw his rein,</p>

<p class="stanza"><a name="Page_39"></a>And, gazing down with a timid grace,<br />
She felt his pleased eyes read her face.</p>

<p class="stanza">Sometimes her narrow kitchen walls<br />
Stretched away into stately halls;</p>

<p class="stanza">The weary wheel to a spinnet turned,<br />
The tallow candle an astral burned;</p>

<p class="stanza">And for him who sat by the chimney lug,<br />
Dozing and grumbling o'er pipe and mug,</p>

<p class="stanza">A manly form at her side she saw,<br />
And joy was duty and love was law.</p>

<p class="stanza">Then she took up her burden of life again,<br />
Saying only, &quot;It might have been.&quot;</p>

<p class="stanza">Alas for maiden, alas for judge,<br />
For rich repiner and household drudge!</p>

<p class="stanza">God pity them both! and pity us all,<br />
Who vainly the dreams of youth recall;</p>

<p class="stanza">For of all sad words of tongue or pen,<br />
The saddest are these: &quot;It might have been!&quot;</p>

<p class="stanza">Ah, well! for us all some sweet hope lies<br />
Deeply buried from human eyes;</p>

<p class="stanza">And, in the hereafter, angels may<br />
Roll the stone from its grave away!</p>

<p class="stanza">The dews of summer night did fall;<br />

<p class="stanza">
Now naught was heard beneath the skies,<br />
<span class="i2">The sounds of busy life were still,</span>

</p>
<p class="stanza">
&quot;Then, Earl, why didst thou leave the beds<br />

The mastiff bowled at village door,<br />

And in that manor now no more<br />

<p class="title"><a name="THE_DIRTY_OLD_MAN"></a>THE DIRTY OLD MAN.</p>
<p class="subt">A LAY OF LEADENHALL.</p>
<p class="cmt">[A singular man, named Nathaniel Bentley, for many years kept a large hardware-shop in Leadenhall Street, London. He was best know as Dirty Dick (Dick, for alliteration's sake, probably), and his place of
business as the Dirty Warehouse. He died about the year 1809. These
verses accord with the accounts respecting himself and his house.]</p>

<p class="stanza">In a dirty old house lived a Dirty Old Man;<br />
Soap, towels, or brushes were not in his plan.<br />
For forty long years, as the neighbors declared,<br />
His house never once had been cleaned or repaired.
</p>
<p class="stanza">'T was a scandal and shame to the business-like street,<br />
One terrible blot in a ledger so neat:<br />
The shop full of hardware, but black as a hearse,<br />
And the rest of the mansion a thousand times worse.
</p>
<p class="stanza">Outside, the old plaster, all spatter and stain,<br />
Looked spotty in sunshine and streaky in rain;<br />
<a name="Page_56"></a>The window-sills sprouted with mildewy grass,<br />
And the panes from being broken were known to be glass.
</p>
<p class="stanza">On the rickety sign-board no learning could spell<br />
The merchant who sold, or the goods he'd to sell;<br />
But for house and for man a new title took growth,<br />
Like a fungus,&mdash;the Dirt gave its name to them both.
</p>
<p class="stanza">Within, there were carpets and cushions of dust,<br />
The wood was half rot, and the metal half rust.<br />
Old curtains, half cobwebs, hung grimly aloof;<br />
'T was a Spiders' Elysium from cellar to roof.
</p>
<p class="stanza">There, king of the spiders, the Dirty Old Man<br />
Lives busy and dirty as ever he can;<br />
With dirt on his fingers and dirt on his face,<br />
For the Dirty Old Man thinks the dirt no disgrace.
</p>
<p class="stanza">From his wig to his shoes, from his coat to his shirt,<br />
His clothes are a proverb, a marvel of dirt;<br />
The dirt is pervading, unfading, exceeding,&mdash;<br />
Yet the Dirty Old Man has both learning and breeding.
</p>
<p class="stanza">Fine dames from their carriages, noble and fair,<br />
Have entered his shop, less to buy than to stare;<br />
And have afterwards said, though the dirt was so frightful,<br />
The Dirty Man's manners were truly delightful.
</p>
<p class="stanza"><a name="Page_57"></a>Upstairs might they venture, in dirt and in gloom,<br />
To peep at the door of the wonderful room<br />
Such stories are told about, none of them true!&mdash;<br />
The keyhole itself has no mortal seen through.
</p>
<p class="stanza">That room,&mdash;forty years since, folk settled and decked it.<br />
The luncheon's prepared, and the guests are expected,<br />
The handsome young host he is gallant and gay,<br />
For his love and her friends will be with him today.
</p>
<p class="stanza">With solid and dainty the table is drest,<br />
The wine beams its brightest, the flowers bloom their best;<br />
Yet the host need not smile, and no guests will appear,<br />
For his sweetheart is dead, as he shortly shall hear.
</p>
<p class="stanza">Full forty years since turned the key in that door.<br />
'T is a room deaf and dumb mid the city's uproar.<br />
The guests, for whose joyance that table was spread,<br />
May now enter as ghosts, for they're every one dead.
</p>
<p class="stanza">Through a chink in the shutter dim lights come and go;<br />
The seats are in order, the dishes a-row:<br />
<a name="Page_58"></a>But the luncheon was wealth to the rat and the mouse<br />
Whose descendants have long left the Dirty Old House.
</p>
<p class="stanza">Cup and platter are masked in thick layers of dust;<br />
The flowers fallen to powder, the wine swathed in crust;<br />
A nosegay was laid before one special chair,<br />
And the faded blue ribbon that bound it lies there.
</p>
<p class="stanza">The old man has played out his part in the scene.<br />
Wherever he now is, I hope he's more clean.<br />
Yet give we a thought free of scoffing or ban<br />
To that Dirty Old House and that Dirty Old Man.</p>

Down to the little river,<br />
In sun or in shadow<br />
I shall not dazzle or shiver,<br />

Or a cloudy violet clearing to blue,<br />
I could look on it forever.

<p class="stanza">Wheel, wheel through the sunshine,<br />
Wheel, wheel through the shadow;<br />
There must be odors round the pine,<br />
There must be balm of breathing kine,<br />

Beyond the beckoning poplars, where<br />
The larch is snooding her flowery hair<br />
With wreaths of morning shadow.
</p>
<p class="stanza">Among the thickest hazels of the brake<br />
Perchance some nightingale doth shake<br />
His feathers, and the air is full of song;<br />
In those old days when I was young and strong,<br />
He used to sing on yonder garden tree,<br />
Beside the nursery.<br />
Ah, I remember how I loved to wake,<br />
And find him singing on the self-same bough<br />
(I know it even now)<br />
Where, since the flit of bat,<br />
In ceaseless voice he sat,<br />
Trying the spring night over, like a tune,<br />
Beneath the vernal moon;<br />
And while I listed long,<br />
<a name="Page_60"></a>Day rose, and still he sang,<br />
And all his stanchless song,<br />
As something falling unaware,<br />
Fell out of the tall trees he sang among,<br />
Fell ringing down the ringing morn, and rang,&mdash;<br />
Rang like a golden jewel down a golden stair.

Softly afloat on a sunny sea,<br />
Two worlds are whispering over me,<br />
And there blows a wind of roses<br />
From the backward shore to the shore before,<br />
From the shore before to the backward shore,<br />
And like two clouds that meet and pour<br />
Each through each, till core in core<br />
A single self reposes,<br />
The nevermore with the evermore<br />
Above me mingles and closes;<br />
As my soul lies out like the basking hound,<br />

My work is done forever,<br />

Cooled at once by that blood-let<br />
Upon the parapet;<br />
And all the tedious task&egrave;d toil of the difficult long endeavor<br />
Solved and quit by no more fine<br />
Than these limbs of mine,<br />
Spanned and measured once for all<br />
By that right-hand I lost,<br />
Bought up at so light a cost<br />
As one bloody fall<br />
On the soldier's bed,<br />
And three days on the ruined wall<br />
Among the thirstless dead.

From duty's muster-roll;<br />

Was emptied out to feed<br />
That fire of pain that burned so brief awhile,&mdash;<br />
That fire from which I come, as the dead come<br />
<a name="Page_62"></a>Forth from the irreparable tomb,<br />
Or as a martyr on his funeral pile<br />
Heaps up the burdens other men do bear<br />
Through years of segregated care,<br />

Upon his shoulders broad,<br />
And steps from earth to God.
</p>
<p class="stanza">O, to think, through good or ill,<br />

Perhaps, O even she<br />
May look as she looked when I knew her<br />
In those old days of childish sooth,<br />
Ere my boyhood dared to woo her.<br />
I will not seek nor sue her,<br />
For I'm neither fonder nor truer<br />
Than when she slighted my lovelorn youth,<br />
My giftless, graceless, guinealess truth,<br />
And I only lived to rue her.<br />
But I'll never love another,<br />

She shall love me yet, my brother!

While his mother speaks his praises,<br />

And lifts a wondering joy,<br />
So I'll not seek nor sue her,<br />
But I'll leave my glory to woo her,<br />

And from behind the purple pride<br />
I'll lift my eyes unto her,<br />
And I shall not be denied.<br />
And you will love her, brother dear,<br />
And perhaps next year you'll bring me here<br />
All through the balmy April tide,<br />
And she will trip like spring by my side,<br />
And be all the birds to my ear.

<p class="stanza"><a name="Page_64"></a>And here all three we'll sit in the sun,<br />
And see the Aprils one by one,<br />
Primrosed Aprils on and on,<br />

<p class="title">THE DREAM.</p>

<p class="stanza">
Our life is twofold; sleep hath its own world,<br />
A boundary between the things misnamed<br />
Death and existence: sleep hath its own world,<br />
And a wide realm of wild reality,<br />
And dreams in their development have breath,<br />
And tears, and tortures, and the touch of joy;<br />
They leave a weight upon our waking thoughts,<br />
They take a weight from off our waking toils,<br />
They do divide our being; they become<br />
A portion of ourselves as of our time,<br />
And look like heralds of eternity;<br />
They pass like spirits of the past,&mdash;they speak<br />
Like sibyls of the future; they have power,&mdash;<br />
The tyranny of pleasure and of pain;<br />
They make us what we were not,&mdash;what they will,<br />
And shake us with the vision that's gone by.<br />
The dread of vanished shadows.&mdash;Are they so?<br />
Is not the past all shadow? What are they?<br />
Creations of the mind?&mdash;The mind can make<br />
<a name="Page_74"></a>Substances, and people planets of its own<br />
With beings brighter than have been, and give<br />
A breath to forms which can outlive all flesh.<br />
I would recall a vision which I dreamed<br />
Perchance in sleep,&mdash;for in itself a thought,<br />
A slumbering thought, is capable of years,<br />
And curdles a long life into one hour.
</p><p class="stanza">
I saw two beings in the hues of youth<br />
Standing upon a hill, a gentle hill,<br />
Green and of a mild declivity, the last<br />
As 't were the cape of a long ridge of such,<br />
Save that there was no sea to lave its base,<br />
But a most living landscape, and the wave<br />
Of woods and cornfields, and the abodes of men<br />
Scattered at intervals, and wreathing smoke<br />
Arising from such rustic roofs; the hill<br />
Was crowned with a peculiar diadem<br />
Of trees, in circular array, so fixed,<br />
Not by the sport of nature, but of man:<br />
These two, a maiden and a youth, were there<br />
Gazing,&mdash;the one on all that was beneath<br />
Fair as herself,&mdash;but the boy gazed on her;<br />
And both were young, and one was beautiful;<br />
And both were young,&mdash;yet not alike in youth.<br />
As the sweet moon on the horizon's verge,<br />
The maid was on the eve of womanhood;<br />
The boy had fewer summers, but his heart<br />
Had far outgrown his years, and to his eye<br />
There was but one beloved face on earth,<br />
And that was shining on him; he had looked<br />
Upon it till it could not pass away;<br />
He had no breath, no being, but in hers;<br />
<a name="Page_75"></a>She was his voice; he did not speak to her,<br />
But trembled on her words; she was his sight,<br />
For his eye followed hers, and saw with hers,<br />
Which colored all his objects;&mdash;he had ceased<br />
To live with himself: she was his life,<br />
The ocean to the river of his thoughts,<br />
Which terminated all; upon a tone,<br />
A touch of hers, his blood would ebb and flow,<br />
And his cheek change tempestuously;&mdash;his heart<br />
Unknowing of its cause of agony.<br />
But she in these fond feelings had no share:<br />
Her sighs were not for him; to her he was<br />
Even as a brother,&mdash;but no more; 'twas much,<br />
For brotherless she was, save in the name<br />
Her infant friendship had bestowed on him;<br />
Herself the solitary scion left<br />
Of a time-honored race. It was a name<br />
Which pleased him, and yet pleased him not,&mdash;and why?<br />
Time taught him a deep answer&mdash;when she loved<br />
Another; even <i>now</i> she loved another,<br />
And on the summit of the hill she stood,<br />
Looking afar if yet her lover's steed<br />
Kept pace with her expectancy, and flew.
</p><p class="stanza">
A change came o'er the spirit of my dream.<br />
There was an ancient mansion, and before<br />
Its walls there was a steed caparisoned;<br />
Within an antique oratory stood<br />
The boy of whom I spake;&mdash;he was alone,<br />
And pale, and pacing to and fro: anon<br />
He sate him down, and seized a pen and traced<br />
Words which I could not guess of; then he leaned<br />
<a name="Page_76"></a>His bowed head on his hands and shook, as 'twere<br />
With a convulsion,&mdash;then arose again,<br />
And with his teeth and quivering hands did tear<br />
What he had written, but he shed no tears,<br />
And he did calm himself, and fix his brow<br />
Into a kind of quiet; as he paused,<br />
The lady of his love re-entered there;<br />
She was serene and smiling then, and yet<br />
She knew she was by him beloved; she knew&mdash;<br />
For quickly comes such knowledge&mdash;that his heart<br />
Was darkened with her shadow, and she saw<br />
That he was wretched, but she saw not all.<br />
He rose, and with a cold and gentle grasp<br />
He took her hand; a moment o'er his face<br />
A tablet of unutterable thoughts<br />
Was traced, and then it faded, as it came;<br />
He dropped the hand he held, and with slow steps<br />
Retired, but not as bidding her adieu,<br />
For they did part with mutual smiles; he passed<br />
From out the massy gate of that old Hall,<br />
And mounting on his steed he went his way;<br />
And ne'er repassed that hoary threshold more.
</p><p class="stanza">
A change came o'er the spirit of my dream.<br />
The boy was sprung to manhood; in the wilds<br />
Of fiery climes he made himself a home,<br />
And his soul drank their sunbeams; he was girt<br />
With strange and dusky aspects; he was not<br />
Himself like what he had been; on the sea<br />
And on the shore he was a wanderer;<br />
There was a mass of many images<br />
Crowded like waves upon me, but he was<br />
A part of all; and in the last he lay<br />
<a name="Page_77"></a>Reposing from the noontide sultriness,<br />
Couched among fallen columns, in the shade<br />
Of ruined walls that had survived the names<br />
Of those who reared them; by his sleeping side<br />
Stood camels grazing, and some goodly steeds<br />
Were fastened near a fountain; and a man,<br />
Clad in a flowing garb, did watch the while,<br />
While many of his tribe slumbered around:<br />
And they were canopied by the blue sky,<br />
So cloudless, clear, and purely beautiful,<br />
That God alone was to be seen in heaven.
</p><p class="stanza">
A change came o'er the spirit of my dream.<br />
The lady of his love was wed with one<br />
Who did not love her better: in her home,<br />
A thousand leagues from his,&mdash;her native home,<br />
She dwelt, begirt with growing infancy,<br />
Daughters and sons of beauty,&mdash;but behold!<br />
Upon her face there was the tint of grief,<br />
The settled shadow of an inward strife,<br />
And an unquiet drooping of the eye,<br />
As if its lids were charged with unshed tears.<br />
What could her grief be?&mdash;she had all she loved,<br />
And he who had so loved her was not there<br />
To trouble with bad hopes, or evil wish,<br />
Or ill-repressed affliction, her pure thoughts.<br />
What could her grief be?&mdash;she had loved him not,<br />
Nor given him cause to deem himself beloved,<br />
Nor could he be a part of that which preyed<br />
Upon her mind&mdash;a spectre of the past.
</p><p class="stanza">
A change came o'er the spirit of my dream.<br />
The wanderer was returned.&mdash;I saw him stand<br />
<a name="Page_78"></a>Before an altar&mdash;with a gentle bride;<br />
Her face was fair, but was not that which made<br />
The starlight of his boyhood;&mdash;as he stood<br />
Even at the altar, o'er his brow there came<br />
The selfsame aspect and the quivering shock<br />
That in the antique oratory shook<br />
His bosom in its solitude; and then&mdash;<br />
As in that hour&mdash;a moment o'er his face<br />
The tablet of unutterable thoughts<br />
Was traced,&mdash;and then it faded as it came,<br />
And he stood calm and quiet, and he spoke<br />
The fitting vows, but heard not his own words,<br />
And all things reeled around him; he could see<br />
Not that which was, nor that which should have been,&mdash;<br />
But the old mansion, and the accustomed hall,<br />
And the remembered chambers, and the place,<br />
The day, the hour, the sunshine, and the shade,<br />
All things pertaining to that place and hour,<br />
And her who was his destiny, came back<br />
And thrust themselves between him and the light;<br />
What business had they there at such a time?
</p><p class="stanza">
A change came o'er the spirit of my dream.<br />
The lady of his love;&mdash;O, she was changed,<br />
As by the sickness of the soul! her mind<br />
Had wandered from its dwelling, and her eyes,<br />
They had not their own lustre, but the look<br />
Which is not of the earth; she was become<br />
The queen of a fantastic realm; her thoughts<br />
Were combinations of disjointed things,<br />
And forms impalpable and unperceived<br />
Of others' sight familiar were to hers.<br />
<a name="Page_79"></a>And this the world calls frenzy; but the wise<br />
Have a far deeper madness, and the glance<br />
Of melancholy is a fearful gift;<br />
What is it but the telescope of truth,<br />
Which strips the distance of its fantasies,<br />
And brings life near in utter nakedness,<br />
Making the cold reality too real!
</p><p class="stanza">
A change came o'er the spirit of my dream.<br />
The wanderer was alone as heretofore,<br />
The beings which surrounded him were gone,<br />
Or were at war with him; he was a mark<br />
For blight and desolation, compassed round<br />
With hatred and contention; pain was mixed<br />
In all which was served up to him, until,<br />
Like to the Pontic monarch of old days,<br />
He fed on poisons, and they had no power,<br />
But were a kind of nutriment; he lived<br />
Through that which had been death to many men,<br />
And made him friends of mountains: with the stars<br />
And the quick Spirit of the universe<br />
He held his dialogues; and they did teach<br />
To him the magic of their mysteries;<br />
To him the book of Night was opened wide,<br />
And voices from the deep abyss revealed<br />
A marvel and a secret.&mdash;Be it so.
</p><p class="stanza">
My dream was past; it had no further change.<br />
It was of a strange order, that the doom<br />
Of these two creatures should be thus traced out<br />
Almost like a reality,&mdash;the one<br />
To end in madness&mdash;both in misery.</p>

They wore in courtship's smiling day;<br />

A tenderness round all they said;<br />
Till fast declining, one by one,<br />
The sweetnesses of love are gone,<br />
And hearts, so lately mingled, seem<br />
Like broken clouds,&mdash;or like the stream,<br />
That smiling left the mountain's brow,<br />
<span class="i2">As though its waters ne'er could sever,</span>
Yet, ere it reach the plain below,<br />
<span class="i2">Breaks into floods that part forever.</span>
</p>
<p class="stanza"><a name="Page_81"></a>
O you, that have the charge of Love,<br />
<span class="i2">Keep him in rosy bondage bound,</span>
As in the Fields of Bliss above<br />
<span class="i2">He sits, with flowerets fettered round;&mdash;</span>
Loose not a tie that round him clings,<br />
Nor ever let him use his wings;<br />
For even an hour, a minute's flight<br />
Will rob the plumes of half their light.<br />
Like that celestial bird,&mdash;whose nest<br />
<span class="i2">Is found beneath far Eastern skies,&mdash;</span>
Whose wings, though radiant when at rest,<br />
<span class="i2">Lose all their glory when he flies!</span></p>

<p class="title">THE PORTRAIT.</p>

<p class="stanza">Midnight past! Not a sound of aught<br />
<span class="i2">Through the silent house, but the wind at his prayers.</span>
<a name="Page_83"></a>I sat by the dying fire, and thought<br />
<span class="i2">Of the dear dead woman upstairs.</span>
</p>
<p class="stanza">A night of tears! for the gusty rain<br />
<span class="i2">Had ceased, but the eaves were dripping yet;</span>
And the moon looked forth, as though in pain,<br />
<span class="i2">With her face all white and wet:</span>
</p>
<p class="stanza">Nobody with me, my watch to keep,<br />
<span class="i2">But the friend of my bosom, the man I love:</span>
And grief had sent him fast to sleep<br />
<span class="i2">In the chamber up above.</span>
</p>
<p class="stanza">Nobody else, in the country place<br />
<span class="i2">All round, that knew of my loss beside,</span>
But the good young Priest with the Raphael-face,<br />
<span class="i2">Who confessed her when she died.</span>
</p>
<p class="stanza">That good young Priest is of gentle nerve,<br />
<span class="i2">And my grief had moved him beyond control;</span>
For his lips grew white, as I could observe,<br />
<span class="i2">When he speeded her parting soul.</span>
</p>
<p class="stanza">I sat by the dreary hearth alone:<br />
<span class="i2">I thought of the pleasant days of yore:</span>
I said, &quot;The staff of my life is gone:<br />
<span class="i2">The woman I loved is no more.</span>
</p>
<p class="stanza">&quot;On her cold dead bosom my portrait lies,<br />
<span class="i2">Which next to her heart she used to wear&mdash;</span>
Haunting it o'er with her tender eyes<br />
<span class="i2">When my own face was not there.</span>
</p>
<p class="stanza"><a name="Page_84"></a>&quot;It is set all round with rubies red,<br />
<span class="i2">And pearls which a Peri, might have kept.</span>
For each ruby there my heart hath bled:<br />
<span class="i2">For each pearl my eyes have wept.&quot;</span>
</p>
<p class="stanza">And I said&mdash;&quot;The thing is precious to me:<br />
<span class="i2">They will bury her soon in the churchyard clay;</span>
It lies on her heart, and lost must be<br />
<span class="i2">If I do not take it away.&quot;</span>
</p>
<p class="stanza">I lighted my lamp at the dying flame,<br />
<span class="i2">And crept up the stairs that creaked for fright,</span>
Till into the chamber of death I came,<br />
<span class="i2">Where she lay all in white.</span>
</p>
<p class="stanza">The moon shone over her winding-sheet,<br />
<span class="i2">There stark she lay on her carven bed:</span>
Seven burning tapers about her feet,<br />
<span class="i2">And seven about her head.</span>
</p>
<p class="stanza">As I stretched my hand, I held my breath;<br />
<span class="i2">I turned as I drew the curtains apart:</span>
I dared not look on the face of death:<br />
<span class="i2">I knew where to find her heart.</span>
</p>
<p class="stanza">I thought at first, as my touch fell there,<br />
<span class="i2">It had warmed that heart to life, with love;</span>
For the thing I touched was warm, I swear,<br />
<span class="i2">And I could feel it move.</span>
</p>
<p class="stanza">'Twas the hand of a man, that was moving slow<br />
<span class="i2">O'er the heart of the dead,&mdash;from the other side:</span>
<a name="Page_85"></a>And at once the sweat broke over my brow.<br />
<span class="i2">&quot;Who is robbing the corpse?&quot; I cried.</span>
</p>
<p class="stanza">Opposite me by the tapers' light,<br />
<span class="i2">The friend of my bosom, the man I loved,</span>
Stood over the corpse, and all as white,<br />
<span class="i2">And neither of us moved.</span>
</p>
<p class="stanza">&quot;What do you here, my friend?&quot; ... The man<br />
<span class="i2">Looked first at me, and then at the dead.</span>
&quot;There is a portrait here,&quot; he began;<br />
<span class="i2">&quot;There is. It is mine,&quot; I said.</span>
</p>
<p class="stanza">Said the friend of my bosom, &quot;Yours, no doubt,<br />
<span class="i2">The portrait was, till a month ago,</span>
When this suffering angel took that out,<br />
<span class="i2">And placed mine there, I know.&quot;</span>
</p>
<p class="stanza">&quot;This woman, she loved me well,&quot; said I.<br />
<span class="i2">&quot;A month ago,&quot; said my friend to me:</span>
&quot;And in your throat,&quot; I groaned, &quot;you lie!&quot;<br />
<span class="i2">He answered, ... &quot;Let us see.&quot;</span>
</p>
<p class="stanza">&quot;Enough!&quot; I returned, &quot;let the dead decide:<br />
<span class="i2">And whosesoever the portrait prove,</span>
His shall it be, when the cause is tried,<br />
<span class="i2">Where Death is arraigned by Love.&quot;</span>
</p>
<p class="stanza">We found the portrait there, in its place:<br />
<span class="i2">We opened it by the tapers' shine:</span>
The gems were all unchanged: the face<br />
<span class="i2">Was&mdash;neither his nor mine.</span>
</p>
<p class="stanza"><a name="Page_86"></a>&quot;One nail drives out another, at least!<br />
<span class="i2">The face of the portrait there,&quot; I cried,</span>
&quot;Is our friend's, the Raphael-faced young Priest,<br />
<span class="i2">Who confessed her when she died.&quot;</span>
</p>
<p class="stanza">The setting is all of rubies red,<br />
<span class="i2">And pearls which a Peri might have kept.</span>
For each ruby there my heart hath bled:<br />
<span class="i2">For each pearl my eyes have wept.</span>

<span class="i10">&mdash;COVENTRY PATMORE.</span></p>

<p class="stanza">
So, the truth's out. I'll grasp it like a snake,&mdash;<br />
It will not slay me. My heart shall not break<br />
Awhile, if only for the children's sake.
</p>
<p class="stanza">For his, too, somewhat. Let him stand unblamed;<br />
None say, he gave me less than honor claimed,<br />
Except&mdash;one trifle scarcely worth being named&mdash;
</p>
<p class="stanza">The heart. That's gone. The corrupt dead might be<br />
As easily raised up, breathing,&mdash;fair to see,<br />
As he could bring his whole heart back to me.
</p>
<p class="stanza">I never sought him in coquettish sport,<br />
Or courted him as silly maidens court,<br />
And wonder when the longed-for prize falls short.
</p>
<p class="stanza"><a name="Page_87"></a>I only loved him,&mdash;any woman would:<br />
But shut my love up till he came and sued,<br />
Then poured it o'er his dry life like a flood.
</p>
<p class="stanza">I was so happy I could make him blest!&mdash;<br />
So happy that I was his first and best,<br />
As he mine,&mdash;when he took me to his breast.
</p>
<p class="stanza">Ah me! if only then he had been true!<br />
If for one little year, a month or two,<br />
He had given me love for love, as was my due!
</p>
<p class="stanza">Or had he told me, ere the deed was done,<br />
He only raised me to his heart's dear throne&mdash;<br />
Poor substitute&mdash;because the queen was gone!
</p>
<p class="stanza">O, had he whispered, when his sweetest kiss<br />
Was warm upon my mouth in fancied bliss,<br />
He had kissed another woman even as this,&mdash;
</p>
<p class="stanza">It were less bitter! Sometimes I could weep<br />
To be thus cheated, like a child asleep;&mdash;<br />
Were not my anguish far too dry and deep.
</p>
<p class="stanza">So I built my house upon another's ground;<br />
Mocked with a heart just caught at the rebound,&mdash;<br />
A cankered thing that looked so firm and sound.
</p>
<p class="stanza">And when that heart grew colder,&mdash;colder still,<br />
I, ignorant, tried all duties to fulfil,<br />
Blaming my foolish pain, exacting will,
</p>
<p class="stanza"><a name="Page_88"></a>All,&mdash;anything but him. It was to be<br />
The full draught others drink up carelessly<br />
Was made this bitter Tantalus-cup for me.
</p>
<p class="stanza">I say again,&mdash;he gives me all I claimed,<br />
I and my children never shall be shamed:<br />
He is a just man,&mdash;he will live unblamed.
</p>
<p class="stanza">Only&mdash;O God, O God, to cry for bread.<br />
And get a stone! Daily to lay my head<br />
Upon a bosom where the old love's dead!
</p>
<p class="stanza">Dead?&mdash;Fool! It never lived. It only stirred<br />
Galvanic, like an hour-cold corpse. None heard:<br />
So let me bury it without a word.
</p>
<p class="stanza">He'll keep that other woman from my sight.<br />
I know not if her face be foul or bright;<br />
I only know that it was his delight&mdash;
</p>
<p class="stanza">As his was mine; I only know he stands<br />
Pale, at the touch of their long-severed hands,<br />
Then to a flickering smile his lips commands,
</p>
<p class="stanza">Lest I should grieve, or jealous anger show.<br />
He need not. When the ship 's gone down, I trow,<br />
We little reck whatever wind may blow.
</p>
<p class="stanza">And so my silent moan begins and ends,<br />
No world's laugh or world's taunt, no pity of friends<br />
Or sneer of foes, with this my torment blends.
</p>
<p class="stanza"><a name="Page_89"></a>None knows,&mdash;none heeds. I have a little pride;<br />
Enough to stand up, wifelike, by his side,<br />
With the same smile as when I was his bride.
</p>
<p class="stanza">And I shall take his children to my arms;<br />
They will not miss these fading, worthless charms;<br />
Their kiss&mdash;ah! unlike his&mdash;all pain disarms.
</p>
<p class="stanza">And haply as the solemn years go by,<br />
He will think sometimes, with regretful sigh,<br />
The other woman was less true than I.</p>

<p class="title">DOROTHY IN THE GARRET.</p>

<p class="stanza">In the low-raftered garret, stooping<br />
<span class="i2">Carefully over the creaking boards,</span>
Old Maid Dorothy goes a-groping<br />
<span class="i2">Among its dusty and cobwebbed hoards;</span>
Seeking some bundle of patches, hid<br />
<span class="i2">Far under the eaves, or bunch of sage,</span>
Or satchel hung on its nail, amid<br />
<span class="i2">The heirlooms of a bygone age.</span>
</p>
<p class="stanza">There is the ancient family chest,<br />
<span class="i2">There the ancestral cards and hatchel;</span>
Dorothy, sighing, sinks down to rest,<br />
<span class="i2">Forgetful of patches, sage, and satchel.</span>
Ghosts of faces peer from the gloom<br />
<span class="i2">Of the chimney, where with swifts and reel,</span>
And the long-disused, dismantled loom,<br />
<span class="i2">Stands the old-fashioned spinning-wheel.</span>
</p>
<p class="stanza"><a name="Page_90"></a>She sees it back in the clean-swept kitchen,<br />
<span class="i2">A part of her girlhood's little world;</span>
Her mother is there by the window, stitching;<br />
<span class="i2">Spindle buzzes, and reel is whirled</span>
With many a click: on her little stool<br />
<span class="i2">She sits, a child, by the open door,</span>
Watching, and dabbling her feet in the pool<br />
<span class="i2">Of sunshine spilled on the gilded floor</span>
</p>
<p class="stanza">Her sisters are spinning all day long;<br />
<span class="i2">To her wakening sense the first sweet warning</span>
Of daylight come is the cheerful song<br />
<span class="i2">To the hum of the wheel in the early morning.</span>
Benjie, the gentle, red-cheeked boy.<br />
<span class="i2">On his way to school, peeps in at the gate;</span>
In neat white pinafore, pleased and coy,<br />
<span class="i2">She reaches a hand to her bashful mate;</span>
</p>
<p class="stanza">And under the elms, a prattling pair.<br />
<span class="i2">Together they go, through glimmer and gloom:&mdash;</span>
It all comes back to her, dreaming there<br />
<span class="i2">In the low-raftered garret room;</span>
The hum of the wheel, and the summer weather.<br />
<span class="i2">The heart's first trouble, and love's beginning,</span>
Are all in her memory linked together;<br />
<span class="i2">And now it is she herself that is spinning.</span>
</p>
<p class="stanza">With the bloom of youth on cheek and lip.<br />
<span class="i2">Turning the spokes with the flashing pin,</span>
Twisting the thread from the spindle-tip,<br />
<span class="i2">Stretching it out and winding it in.</span>
To and fro, with a blithesome tread,<br />
<span class="i2">Singing she goes, and her heart is full,</span>
<a name="Page_91"></a>And many a long-drawn golden thread<br />
<span class="i2">Of fancy is spun with the shining wool.</span>
</p>
<p class="stanza">Her father sits in his favorite place,<br />
<span class="i2">Puffing his pipe by the chimney-side;</span>
Through curling clouds his kindly face<br />
<span class="i2">Glows upon her with love and pride.</span>
Lulled by the wheel, in the old arm-chair<br />
<span class="i2">Her mother is musing, cat in lap,</span>
With beautiful drooping head, and hair<br />
<span class="i2">Whitening under her snow-white cap.</span>
</p>
<p class="stanza">One by one, to the grave, to the bridal,<br />
<span class="i2">They have followed her sisters from the door;</span>
Now they are old, and she is their idol:&mdash;<br />
<span class="i2">It all comes back on her heart once more.</span>
In the autumn dusk the hearth gleams brightly,<br />
<span class="i2">The wheel is set by the shadowy wall,&mdash;</span>
A hand at the latch,&mdash;'tis lifted lightly,<br />
<span class="i2">And in walks Benjie, manly and tall.</span>
</p>
<p class="stanza">His chair is placed; the old man tips<br />
<span class="i2">The pitcher, and brings his choicest fruit;</span>
Benjie basks in the blaze, and sips,<br />
<span class="i2">And tells his story, and joints his flute:</span>
O, sweet the tunes, the talk, the laughter!<br />
<span class="i2">They fill the hour with a glowing tide;</span>
But sweeter the still, deep moments after,<br />
<span class="i2">When she is alone by Benjie's side.</span>
</p>
<p class="stanza">But once with angry words they part:<br />
<span class="i2">O, then the weary, weary days!</span>
<a name="Page_92"></a>Ever with restless, wretched heart,<br />
<span class="i2">Plying her task, she turns to gaze</span>
Far up the road; and early and late<br />
<span class="i2">She harks for a footstep at the door,</span>
And starts at the gust that swings the gate,<br />
<span class="i2">And prays for Benjie, who comes no more.</span>
</p>
<p class="stanza">Her fault? O Benjie, and could you steel<br />
<span class="i2">Your thoughts towards one who loved you so?&mdash;</span>
Solace she seeks in the whirling wheel,<br />
<span class="i2">In duty and love that lighten woe;</span>
Striving with labor, not in vain,<br />
<span class="i2">To drive away the dull day's dreariness,&mdash;</span>
Blessing the toil that blunts the pain<br />
<span class="i2">Of a deeper grief in the body's weariness.</span>
</p>
<p class="stanza">Proud and petted and spoiled was she:<br />
<span class="i2">A word, and all her life is changed!</span>
His wavering love too easily<br />
<span class="i2">In the great, gay city grows estranged:</span>
One year: she sits in the old church pew;<br />
<span class="i2">A rustle, a murmur,&mdash;O Dorothy! hide</span>
Your face and shut from your soul the view&mdash;<br />
<span class="i2">'Tis Benjie leading a white-veiled bride!</span>
</p>
<p class="stanza">Now father and mother have long been dead,<br />
<span class="i2">And the bride sleeps under a churchyard stone,</span>
And a bent old man with a grizzled head<br />
<span class="i2">Walks up the long dim aisle alone.</span>
Years blur to a mist; and Dorothy<br />
<span class="i2">Sits doubting betwixt the ghost she seems,</span>
And the phantom of youth, more real than she,<br />
<span class="i2">That meets her there in that haunt of dreams.</span>
</p>
<p class="stanza"><a name="Page_93"></a>Bright young Dorothy, idolized daughter,<br />
<span class="i2">Sought by many a youthful adorer,</span>
Life, like a new-risen dawn on the water,<br />

Old Maid Dorothy, wrinkled and gray,<br />
<span class="i2">Groping under the farm-house eaves,&mdash;</span>
And life was a brief November day<br />
<span class="i2">That sets on a world of withered leaves!</span>
</p>
<p class="stanza">Yet faithfulness in the humblest part<br />
<span class="i2">Is better at last than proud success,</span>
And patience and love in a chastened heart<br />
<span class="i2">Are pearls more precious than happiness;</span>
And in that morning when she shall wake<br />
<span class="i2">To the spring-time freshness of youth again,</span>
All trouble will seem but a flying flake,<br />
<span class="i2">And lifelong sorrow a breath on the pane.</span>

<p class="title">PARTING.</p>

<p class="stanza">If thou dost bid thy friend farewell,<br />
But for one night though that farewell may be,<br />
Press thou his hand in thine.<br />
How canst thou tell how far from thee<br />
Fate or caprice may lead his steps ere that to-morrow comes?<br />
Men have been known to lightly turn the corner of a street,<br />
And days have grown to months, and months to lagging years,<br />
Ere they have looked in loving eyes again.<br />
Parting, at best, is underlaid<br />
With tears and pain.<br />
Therefore, lest sudden death should come between.<br />
Or time, or distance, clasp with pressure firm<br />
The hand of him who goeth forth;<br />
Unseen, Fate goeth too.<br />
Yes, find thou always time to say some earnest word<br />
Between the idle talk,<br />
Lest with thee henceforth,<br />
Night and day, regret should walk.</p>

All in the Downs the fleet was moored,<br />
<span class="i2">The streamers waving in the wind,</span>
When black-eyed Susan came aboard;<br />
<span class="i2">&quot;O, where shall I my true-love find?</span>
Tell me, ye jovial sailors, tell me true<br />
If my sweet William sails among the crew.&quot;

<span class="i2">Rocked with the billow to and fro,</span>
Soon as her well-known voice he heard<br />

The cord slides swiftly through his glowing hands,<br />
And quick as lightning on the deck he stands.
</p>

<span class="i2">My vows shall ever true remain;</span>
Let me kiss off that falling tear;<br />

The faithful compass that still points to thee.
</p>
<p class="stanza">&quot;Believe not what the landmen say<br />
<span class="i2">Who tempt with doubts thy constant mind;</span>
They'll tell thee, sailors, when away,<br />
<span class="i2">In every port a mistress find;</span>
Yes, yes, believe them when they tell thee so,<br />
For thou art present wheresoe'er I go.

<span class="i2">Thy eyes are seen in diamonds bright,</span>
Thy breath is Afric's spicy gale,<br />
<span class="i2">Thy skin is ivory so white.</span>
Thus every beauteous object that I view<br />
Wakes in my soul some charm of lovely Sue.

<span class="i2">Let not my pretty Susan mourn;</span>
Though cannons roar, yet safe from harms<br />
<span class="i2">William shall to his dear return.</span>
Love turns aside the balls that round me fly,<br />

They'll ne'er make a tempest like that in my mind;<br />
Though loudest of thunder on louder waves roar,<br />
That's naething like leaving my love on the shore.<br />
To leave thee behind me my heart is sair pained;<br />
By ease that's inglorious no fame can be gained;<br />
And beauty and love's the reward of the brave,<br />
And I must deserve it before I can crave.

Without it I ne'er can have merit for thee,<br />

<p class="stanza">Farewell! thou art too dear for my possessing,<br />
And like enough thou know'st thy estimate:<br />
The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing;<br />
My bonds in thee are all determinate.<br />
For how do I hold thee but by thy granting?<br />
And for that riches where is my deserving?<br />
The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting,<br />
And so my patent back again is swerving.<br />
Thyself thou gav'st, thy own worth then not knowing?<br />
Or me, to whom thou gav'st it, else mistaking;<br />
So thy great gift, upon misprision growing,<br />
Comes home again, on better judgment making.<br />
Thus have I had thee, as a dream doth flatter;<br />
In sleep a king, but, waking, no such matter.</p>

Ah too forgetful of thy wife and son!<br />
And think'st thou not how wretched we shall be,<br />
A widow I, a helpless orphan he!<br />
For sure such courage length of life denies,<br />
And thou must fall, thy virtue's sacrifice.<br />
Greece in her single heroes strove in vain;<br />
Now hosts oppose thee, and thou must be slain!<br />
Oh grant me, gods! ere Hector meets his doom,<br />
All I can ask of heaven, an early tomb!<br />
So shall my days in one sad tenor run,<br />
And end with sorrows as they first begun.<br />
No parent now remains, my griefs to share,<br />
No father's aid, no mother's tender care.<br />
The fierce Achilles wrapt our walls in fire,<br />
Laid Theb&egrave; waste, and slew my warlike sire!<br />
His fate compassion in the victor bred;<br />
Stern as he was, he yet revered the dead,<br />
His radiant arms preserved from hostile spoil,<br />
And laid him decent on the funeral pile;<br />
Then raised a mountain where his bones were burned;<br />
The mountain nymphs the rural tomb adorned;<br />
Jove's sylvan daughters bade their elms bestow<br />
A barren shade, and in his honor grow.<br /></p>

My father, mother, brethren, all, in thee.<br />
Alas! my parents, brothers, kindred, all,<br />
Once more will perish if my Hector fall.<br />
Thy wife, thy infant, in thy danger share;<br />
Oh prove a husband's and a father's care!<br />
That quarter most the skillful Greeks annoy,<br />
Where yon wild fig-trees join the wall of Troy:<br />
Thou, from this tower defend th'important post;<br />
There Agamemnon points his dreadful host,<br />
That pass Tydides, Ajax, strive to gain,<br />
And there the vengeful Spartan fires his train.<br />
Thrice our bold foes the fierce attack have given,<br />
Or led by hopes, or dictated from heaven.<br />
Let others in the field their arms employ,<br />
But stay my Hector here, and guard his Troy.&quot;<br />
<span class="i2">The chief replied: &quot;That post shall be my care,</span>
Nor that alone, but all the works of war.<br />
[How would the sons of Troy, in arms renowned,<br />
And Troy's proud dames, whose garments sweep the ground,<br />
Attaint the lustre of my former name,<br />
Should Hector basely quit the field of fame?<br />
My early youth was bred to martial pains,<br />
My soul impels me to th' embattled plains:<br />
Let me be foremost to defend the throne,<br />
And guard my father's glories, and my own.<br />
Yet come it will, the day decreed by fates;<br />
(How my heart trembles while my tongue relates)<br />
The day when thou, imperial Troy! must bend,<br />
And see thy warriors fall, thy glories end.<br />
And yet no dire presage so wounds my mind,<br />
<a name="Page_120"></a>My mother's death, the ruin of my kind,<br />
Not Priam's hoary hairs denied with gore,<br />
Not all my brothers gasping on the shore;<br />
As thine, Andromach&egrave;! thy griefs I dread;<br />
I see thee trembling, weeping, captive led!]<br />
In Argive looms our battles to design,<br />
And woes of which so large a part was thine!<br />
To bear the victor's hard commands or bring<br />
The weight of waters from Hyperia's spring.<br />
There, while you groan beneath the load of life,<br />
They cry, Behold the mighty Hector's wife!<br />
Some haughty Greek, who lives thy tears to see,<br />
Embitters all thy woes by naming me.<br />
The thoughts of glory past, and present shame,<br />
A thousand griefs, shall waken at the name!<br />
May I lie cold before that dreadful day,<br />
Pressed with a load of monumental clay!<br />
Thy Hector, wrapped in everlasting sleep,<br />
Shall neither hear thee sigh, nor see thee weep.&quot;<br />
<span class="i2">Thus having spoke, th' illustrious chief of Troy</span>
Stretched his fond arms to clasp the lovely boy.<br />
The babe clung crying to his nurse's breast,<br />
Scared at the dazzling helm, and nodding crest.<br />
With secret pleasure each fond parent smiled,<br />
And Hector hast&egrave;d to relieve his child;<br />
The glittering terrors from his brows unbound,<br />
And placed the beaming helmet on the ground.<br />
Then kissed the child, and, lifting high in air,<br />
Thus to the gods preferred a father's prayer:<br />
<span class="i2">&quot;O thou whose glory fills th' ethereal throne,</span>
And all ye deathless powers! protect my son!<br />
Grant him, like me, to purchase just renown,<br />
To guard the Trojans, to defend the crown,<br />
<a name="Page_121"></a>Against his country's foes the war to wage,<br />
And rise the Hector of the future age!<br />
So when, triumphant from successful toils,<br />
Of heroes slain he bears the reeking spoils,<br />
Whole hosts may hail him with deserved acclaim,<br />
And say, This chief transcends his father's fame:<br />
While pleased, amidst the general shouts of Troy,<br />
His mother's conscious heart o'erflows with joy.&quot;<br />
<span class="i2">He spoke, and fondly gazing on her charms</span>
Restored the pleasing burden to her arms;<br />
Soft on her fragrant breast the babe she laid,<br />
Hushed to repose, and with a smile surveyed.<br />
The troubled pleasure soon chastised by fear,<br />
She mingled with the smile a tender tear.<br />
The softened chief with kind compassion viewed,<br />
And dried the falling drops, and thus pursued:<br />
<span class="i2">&quot;Andromach&egrave;! my soul's far better part,</span>
Why with untimely sorrows heaves thy heart?<br />
No hostile hand can antedate my doom,<br />
Till fate condemns me to the silent tomb.<br />
Fixed is the term to all the race of earth,<br />
And such the hard condition of our birth.<br />
No force can then resist, no flight can save;<br />
All sink alike, the fearful and the brave.<br />
No more&mdash;but hasten to thy tasks at home,<br />
There guide the spindle, and direct the loom:<br />
Me glory summons to the martial scene,<br />
The field of combat is the sphere for men.<br />
Where heroes war, the foremost place I claim,<br />
The first in danger as the first in fame.&quot;<br />
<span class="i2">Thus having said, the glorious chief resumes</span>
His towery helmet, black with shading plumes.<br />
His princess parts with a prophetic sigh,<br />
<a name="Page_122"></a>Unwilling parts, and oft reverts her eye,<br />
That streamed at every look: then, moving slow,<br />
Sought her own palace, and indulged her woe.<br />
There, while her tears deplored the godlike man,<br />
Through all her train the soft infection ran;<br />
The pious maids their mingled sorrows shed,<br />
And mourn the living Hector as the dead.</p>

Well, too well, do I know,&mdash;both my mind and my spirit agreeing,<br />

Priam will perish too, and the people of Priam, the spear-armed.<br />

Nor for my brothers' fate, who, though they be many and valiant,<br />
All in the dust may lie low by the hostile spears of Achaia,<br />

Where the thistle lifts a purple crown<br />

The pang of all the partings gone,<br />
<span class="i2">And partings yet to be.</span>
</p>
<p class="stanza">She left me marvelling why my soul<br />

<p class="stanza">Nothing begins, and nothing ends,<br />
<span class="i2">That is not paid with moan;</span>

<p class="stanza">
Come to me, dearest, I'm lonely without thee,<br />
Daytime and night-time, I'm thinking about thee;<br />
Night-time and daytime, in dreams I behold thee;<br />
Unwelcome the waking which ceases to fold thee.<br />
Come to me, darling, my sorrows to lighten,<br />
Come in thy beauty to bless and to brighten;<br />
Come in thy womanhood, meekly and lowly,<br />
Come in thy lovingness, queenly and holy.
</p>
<p class="stanza">Swallows will flit round the desolate ruin,<br />
Telling of spring and its joyous renewing;<br />
<a name="Page_145"></a>And thoughts of thy love, and its manifold treasure,<br />
Are circling my heart with a promise of pleasure.<br />
O Spring of my spirit, O May of my bosom,<br />
Shine out on my soul, till it bourgeon and blossom;<br />
The waste of my life has a rose-root within it,<br />
And thy fondness alone to the sunshine can win it.

Eyes like the skies of poor Erin, our mother,<br />

Planting in each rosy cheek a sweet dimple;&mdash;<br />
O, thanks to the Saviour, that even thy seeming<br />
Is left to the exile to brighten his dreaming.
</p>
<p class="stanza">You have been glad when you knew I was gladdened;<br />
Dear, are you sad now to hear I am saddened?<br />
Our hearts ever answer in tune and in time, love,<br />
As octave to octave, and rhyme unto rhyme, love:<br />
I cannot weep but your tears will be flowing,<br />
You cannot smile but my cheek will be glowing;<br />
I would not die without you at my side, love,<br />
You will not linger when I shall have died, love.
</p>
<p class="stanza">Come to me, dear, ere I die of my sorrow,<br />
Rise on my gloom like the sun of to-morrow;<br />
Strong, swift, and fond as the words which I speak, love,<br />
<a name="Page_146"></a>With a song on your lip and a smile on your cheek, love.<br />
Come, for my heart in your absence is weary,&mdash;<br />
Haste, for my spirit is sickened and dreary,&mdash;<br />
Come to the arms which alone should caress thee.<br />
Come to the heart that is throbbing to press thee!

The World's a bubble, and the Life of Man<br />

Cromwell, I charge thee, fling away ambition:<br />
By that sin fell the angels; how can man, then,<br />
The image of his Maker, hope to win by 't?<br />
Love thyself last: cherish those hearts that hate thee:<br />
Corruption wins not more than honesty.<br />
Still in thy right hand carry gentle peace,<br />
To silence envious tongues. Be just, and fear not:<br />
Let all the ends thou aim'st at be thy country's,<br />
Thy God's, and truth's; then if thou fall'st, O Cromwell!<br />
Thou fall'st a blessed martyr.<br />
Serve the king; and&mdash;pr'ythee, lead me in:<br />
There take an inventory of all I have,<br />
To the last penny; 'tis the king's: my robe,<br />
<a name="Page_162"></a>And my integrity to heaven, is all<br />
I dare now call mine own. O Cromwell, Cromwell!<br />
Had I but served my God with half the zeal<br />
I served my king, he would not in mine age<br />
Have left me naked to mine enemies!</p>

<p class="stanza">Farewell, a long farewell, to all my greatness!<br />
This is the state of man: to-day he puts forth<br />
The tender leaves of hope; to-morrow blossoms,<br />
And bears his blushing honors thick upon him:<br />
The third day comes a frost, a killing frost;<br />
And&mdash;when he thinks, good easy man, full surely<br />
His greatness is a ripening&mdash;nips his root,<br />
And then he falls, as I do. I have ventured,<br />
Like little wanton boys that swim on bladders,<br />
This many summers in a sea of glory;<br />
But far beyond my depth: my high-blown pride<br />
At length broke under me; and now has left me,<br />
Weary and old with service, to the mercy<br />
Of a rude stream, that must forever hide me.<br />
Vain pomp and glory of this world, I hate ye:<br />
I feel my heart new opened. O, how wretched<br />
Is that poor man that hangs on princes' favors!<br />
There is, betwixt that smile we would aspire to,<br />
That sweet aspect of princes, and their ruin,<br />
More pangs and fears than wars or women have:<br />
And when he falls, he falls like Lucifer,<br />
Never to hope again.</p>

<p class="subt">FROM &quot;TALES OF THE HALL.&quot;</p>

<p class="stanza">
Six years had passed, and forty ere the six,<br />
When Time began to play his usual tricks:<br />
The locks once comely in a virgin's sight,<br />
Locks of pure brown, displayed the encroaching white;<br />
The blood, once fervid, now to cool began,<br />
And Time's strong pressure to subdue the man.<br />
I rode or walked as I was wont before,<br />
But now the bounding spirit was no more;<br />
A moderate pace would now my body heat,<br />
A walk of moderate length distress my feet.<br />
I showed my stranger guest those hills sublime,<br />
But said, &quot;The view is poor, we need not climb.&quot;<br />
At a friend's mansion I began to dread<br />
The cold neat parlor and the gay glazed bed;<br />
At home I felt a more decided taste,<br />
And must have all things in my order placed.<br />
I ceased to hunt; my horses pleased me less,&mdash;<br />
My dinner more; I learned to play at chess.<br />
I took my dog and gun, but saw the brute<br />
Was disappointed that I did not shoot.<br />
My morning walks I now could bear to lose,<br />
And blessed the shower that gave me not to choose.<br />
In fact, I felt a languor stealing on;<br />
The active arm, the agile hand, were gone;<br />
Small daily actions into habits grew,<br />
And new dislike to forms and fashions new.<br />
<a name="Page_164"></a>I loved my trees in order to dispose;<br />
I numbered peaches, looked how stocks arose;<br />
Told the same story oft,&mdash;in short, began to prose.

<p class="stanza">
<span class="i2">The sun is warm, the sky is clear,</span>
<span class="i2">The waves are dancing fast and bright,</span>
<span class="i2">Blue isles and snowy mountains wear</span>
<span class="i2">The purple noon's transparent light:</span>
<span class="i2">The breath of the moist air is light</span>
<span class="i2">Around its unexpanded buds;</span>
<span class="i2">Like many a voice of one delight,&mdash;</span>
<span class="i2">The winds', the birds', the ocean-floods',&mdash;</span>
The City's voice itself is soft like Solitude's.

How sweet, did any heart now share in my emotion!

<span class="i2">My cheek grow cold, and hear the sea</span>
Breathe o'er my dying brain its last monotony.

<span class="i2">In ancient days by emperor and clown:</span>
Perhaps the self-same song that found a path<br />
<span class="i2">Through the sad heart of Ruth, when, sick for home,</span>
<span class="i2">She stood in tears amid the alien corn;</span>
<span class="i6">The same that oft-times hath</span>
<span class="i2">Charmed magic casements opening on the foam</span>
<span class="i4">Of perilous seas, in faery lands forlorn.</span>
</p>
<p class="stanza">Forlorn! the very word is like a bell,<br />
<span class="i2">To toll me back from thee to my sole self!</span>
Adieu! the Fancy cannot cheat so well<br />
<span class="i2">As she is famed to do, deceiving elf.</span>
Adieu! adieu! thy plaintive anthem fades<br />
<span class="i2">Past the near meadows, over the still stream,</span>
<span class="i4">Up the hillside; and now 'tis buried deep</span>
<span class="i6">In the next valley-glades:</span>
<span class="i2">Was it a vision or a waking dream?</span>
<span class="i4">Fled is that music:&mdash;do I wake or sleep?</span>

<p class="fullst">
Over the hill to the poor-house I'm trudgin' my weary way&mdash;<br />
I, a woman of seventy, and only a trifle gray&mdash;<br />
I, who am smart an' chipper, for all the years I've told,<br />
As many another woman that's only half as old.
</p>
<p class="fullst">Over the hill to the poor-house&mdash;I can't quite make it clear!<br />
Over the hill to the poor-house&mdash;it seems so horrid queer!<br />
Many a step I've taken a-toilin' to and fro,<br />
But this is a sort of journey I never thought to go.
</p>
<p class="fullst">What is the use of heapin' on me a pauper's shame?<br />
Am I lazy or crazy? am I blind or lame?<br />
True, I am not so supple, nor yet so awful stout;<br />
But charity ain't no favor, if one can live without.
</p>
<p class="fullst">I am willin' and anxious an' ready any day<br />
To work for a decent livin', an' pay my honest way;<br />
<a name="Page_176"></a>For I can earn my victuals, an' more too, I'll be bound,<br />
If anybody only is willin' to have me round.
</p>
<p class="fullst">Once I was young an' han'some&mdash;I was, upon my soul&mdash;<br />
Once my cheeks was roses, my eyes as black as coal;<br />
And I can't remember, in them days, of hearin' people say,<br />
For any kind of a reason, that I was in their way.
</p>
<p class="fullst">'Tain't no use of boastin', or talkin' over free,<br />
But many a house an' home was open then to me;<br />
Many a ban'some offer I had from likely men,<br />
And nobody ever hinted that I was a burden then.
</p>
<p class="fullst">And when to John I was married, sure he was good and smart,<br />
But he and all the neighbors would own I done my part;<br />
For life was all before me, an' I was young an' strong,<br />
And I worked the best that I could in tryin' to get along.
</p>
<p class="fullst">And so we worked together: and life was hard, but gay,<br />
With now and then a baby for to cheer us on our way;<br />
<a name="Page_177"></a>Till we had half a dozen, an' all growed clean an' neat,<br />
An' went to school like others, an' had enough to eat.
</p>
<p class="fullst">So we worked for the child'rn, and raised 'em every one;<br />
Worked for 'em summer and winter, just as we ought to 've done;<br />
Only perhaps we humored 'em, which some good folks condemn,<br />
But every couple's child'rn 's heap the best to them.
</p>
<p class="fullst">Strange how much we think of our blessed little ones!&mdash;<br />
I'd have died for my daughters, I'd have died for my sons;<br />
And God he made that rule of love; but when we're old and gray,<br />
I've noticed it sometimes somehow fails to work the other way.
</p>
<p class="fullst">Strange, another thing: when our boys an' girls was grown,<br />
And when, exceptin' Charley, they'd left us there alone;<br />
When John he nearer an' nearer come, an' dearer seemed to be,<br />
The Lord of Hosts he come one day an' took him away from me.
</p>
<p class="fullst"><a name="Page_178"></a>Still I was bound to struggle, an' never to cringe or fall&mdash;<br />
Still I worked for Charley, for Charley was now my all;<br />
And Charley was pretty good to me, with scarce a word or frown,<br />
Till at last he went a-courtin', and brought a wife from town.
</p>
<p class="fullst">She was somewhat dressy, an' hadn't a pleasant smile&mdash;<br />
She was quite conceity, and carried a heap o' style;<br />
But if I ever tried to be friends, I did with her, I know;<br />
But she was hard and proud, an' I couldn't make it go.
</p>
<p class="fullst">She had an edication, an' that was good for her;<br />
But when she twitted me on mine, 'twas carryin' things too fur;<br />
An' I told her once, 'fore company (an' it almost made her sick),<br />
That I never swallowed a grammar, or 'et a rithmetic.
</p>
<p class="fullst">So 'twas only a few days before the thing was done&mdash;<br />
They was a family of themselves, and I another one;<br />
And a very little cottage one family will do,<br />
But I never have seen a house that was big enough for two.
</p>
<p class="fullst"><a name="Page_179"></a>An' I could never speak to suit her, never could please her eye,<br />
An' it made me independent, an' then I didn't try;<br />
But I was terribly staggered, an' felt it like a blow,<br />
When Charley turned ag'in me, an' told me I could go.
</p>
<p class="fullst">I went to live with Susan, but Susan's house was small,<br />
And she was always a-hintin' how snug it was for us all;<br />
And what with her husband's sisters, and what with child'rn three,<br />
'Twas easy to discover that there wasn't room for me.
</p>
<p class="fullst">An' then I went to Thomas, the oldest son I've got,<br />
For Thomas's buildings'd cover the half of an acre lot;<br />
But all the child'rn was on me&mdash;I couldn't stand their sauce&mdash;<br />
And Thomas said I needn't think I was comin' there to boss.
</p>
<p class="fullst">An' then I wrote to Rebecca, my girl who lives out West,<br />
And to Isaac, not far from her&mdash;some twenty miles at best;<br />
And one of 'em said 'twas too warm there for any one so old,<br />
<a name="Page_180"></a>And t' other had an opinion the climate was too cold.
</p>
<p class="fullst">So they have shirked and slighted me, an' shifted me about&mdash;<br />
So they have well-nigh soured me, an' wore my old heart out;<br />
But still I've borne up pretty well, an' wasn't much put down,<br />
Till Charley went to the poor-master, an' put me on the town.
</p>
<p class="fullst">Over the hill to the poor-house&mdash;my child'rn dear, good by!<br />
Many a night I've watched you when only God was nigh;<br />
And God'll judge between us; but I will al'ays pray<br />
That you shall never suffer the half I do to-day.

Life's hardest discipline,&mdash;<br />

She stood at the bar of justice,<br />
<span class="i2">A creature wan and wild,</span>

<p class="title"><a name="Page_215"></a>THE FEMALE CONVICT.</p>

<p class="stanza">
She shrank from all, and her silent mood<br />
Made her wish only for solitude:<br />
Her eye sought the ground, as it could not brook,<br />
For innermost shame, on another's to look;<br />
And the cheerings of comfort fell on her ear<br />
Like deadliest words, that were curses to hear!&mdash;<br />
She still was young, and she had been fair;<br />
But weather-stains, hunger, toil, and care,<br />
That frost and fever that wear the heart,<br />
Had made the colors of youth depart<br />
From the sallow cheek, save over it came<br />
The burning flush of the spirit's shame.
</p>
<p class="stanza">They were sailing over the salt sea-foam,<br />
Far from her country, far from her home;<br />
And all she had left for her friends to keep<br />
Was a name to hide and a memory to weep!<br />
And her future held forth but the felon's lot,&mdash;<br />
To live forsaken, to die forgot!<br />
She could not weep, and she could not pray,<br />
But she wasted and withered from day to day,<br />
Till you might have counted each sunken vein,<br />
When her wrist was prest by the iron chain;<br />
And sometimes I thought her large dark eye<br />
Had the glisten of red insanity.
</p>
<p class="stanza">She called me once to her sleeping-place,<br />
A strange, wild look was upon her face,<br />
Her eye flashed over her cheek so white,<br />
Like a gravestone seen in the pale moonlight,<br />
<a name="Page_216"></a>And she spoke in a low, unearthly tone,&mdash;<br />
The sound from mine ear hath never gone!&mdash;<br />
&quot;I had last night the loveliest dream:<br />
My own land shone in the summer beam,<br />
I saw the fields of the golden grain,<br />
I heard the reaper's harvest strain;<br />
There stood on the hills the green pine-tree,<br />
And the thrush and the lark sang merrily.<br />
A long and a weary way I had come;<br />
But I stopped, methought, by mine own sweet home.<br />
I stood by the hearth, and my father sat there,<br />
With pale, thin face, and snow-white hair!<br />
The Bible lay open upon his knee,<br />
But he closed the book to welcome me.<br />
He led me next where my mother lay,<br />
And together we knelt by her grave to pray,<br />
And heard a hymn it was heaven to hear,<br />
For it echoed one to my young days dear.<br />
This dream has waked feelings long, long since fled,<br />
And hopes which I deemed in my heart were dead!<br />
&mdash;We have not spoken, but still I have hung<br />
On the Northern accents that dwell on thy tongue.<br />
To me they are music, to me they recall<br />
The things long hidden by Memory's pall!<br />
Take this long curl of yellow hair,<br />
And give it my father, and tell him my prayer,<br />
My dying prayer, was for him.&quot; ...
</p>
<p class="stanza"><span class="i10">Next day</span>
Upon the deck a coffin lay;<br />
<a name="Page_217"></a>They raised it up, and like a dirge<br />
The heavy gale swept over the surge;<br />
The corpse was cast to the wind and wave,&mdash;<br />
The convict has found in the green sea a grave.

<p class="stanza">
I tell you, hopeless grief is passionless,&mdash;<br />
That only men incredulous of despair,<br />
Half-taught in anguish, through the midnight air<br />
Beat upwards to God's throne in loud access<br />
Of shrieking and reproach. Full desertness,<br />
In souls as countries lieth silent-bare<br />
Under the blanching, vertical eye-glare<br />
Of the absolute heavens. Deep-hearted man, express<br />
Grief for thy Dead in silence like to death;<br />
Most like a monumental statue set<br />
In everlasting watch and moveless woe,<br />
Till itself crumble to the dust beneath.<br />
Touch it: the marble eyelids are not wet&mdash;<br />
If it could weep, it could arise and go.

<p class="stanza">
Afar in the desert I love to ride,<br />
With the silent Bush-boy alone by my side:<br />
When the sorrows of life the soul o'ercast,<br />
And, sick of the present, I cling to the past;<br />
When the eye is suffused with regretful tears,<br />
From the fond recollections of former years;<br />
And shadows of things that have long since fled<br />
Flit over the brain, like the ghosts of the dead,&mdash;<br />
Bright visions of glory that vanished too soon;<br />
Day-dreams, that departed ere manhood's noon;<br />
Attachments by fate or falsehood reft;<br />
Companions of early days lost or left;<br />
And my native land, whose magical name<br />
Thrills to the heart like electric flame;<br />
The home of my childhood; the haunts of my prime;<br />
All the passions and scenes of that rapturous time<br />
When the feelings were young, and the world was new,<br />
Like the fresh bowers of Eden unfolding to view;<br />
All, all now forsaken, forgotten, foregone!<br />
And I, a lone exile remembered of none,<br />
My high aims abandoned, my good acts undone,<br />
Aweary of all that is under the sun,<br />
<a name="Page_223"></a>With that sadness of heart which no stranger may scan,<br />
I fly to the desert afar from man.
</p>
<p class="stanza">Afar in the desert I love to ride,<br />
With the silent Bush-boy alone by my side!<br />
When the wild turmoil of this wearisome life,<br />
With its scenes of oppression, corruption, and strife,<br />
The proud man's frown, and the base man's fear,<br />
The scorner's laugh, and the sufferer's tear,<br />
And malice, and meanness, and falsehood, and folly,<br />
Dispose me to musing and dark melancholy;<br />
When my bosom is full, and my thoughts are high,<br />
And my soul is sick with the bondman's sigh,&mdash;<br />
O, then there is freedom, and joy, and pride,<br />
Afar in the desert alone to ride!<br />
There is rapture to vault on the champing steed,<br />
And to bound away with the eagle's speed,<br />
With the death-fraught firelock in my hand,&mdash;<br />
The only law of the Desert Land!
</p>
<p class="stanza">Afar in the desert I love to ride,<br />
With the silent Bush-boy alone by my side,<br />
Away, away from the dwellings of men,<br />
By the wild deer's haunt, by the buffalo's glen;<br />
By valleys remote where the oribi plays,<br />
Where the gnu, the gazelle, and the hart&egrave;beest graze,<br />
And the kudu and eland unhunted recline<br />
By the skirts of gray forest o'erhung with wild vine;<br />
<a name="Page_224"></a>Where the elephant browses at peace in his wood,<br />
And the river-horse gambols unscared in the flood,<br />
And the mighty rhinoceros wallows at will<br />
In the fen where the wild ass is drinking his fill.
</p>
<p class="stanza">Afar in the desert I love to ride,<br />
With the silent Bush-boy alone by my side,<br />
O'er the brown karroo, where the bleating cry<br />
Of the springbok's fawn sounds plaintively;<br />
And the timorous quagga's shrill whistling neigh<br />
Is heard by the fountain at twilight gray;<br />
Where the zebra wantonly tosses his mane.<br />
With wild hoof scouring the desolate plain;<br />
And the fleet-footed ostrich over the waste<br />
Speeds like a horseman who travels in haste,<br />
Hieing away to the home of her rest,<br />
Where she and her mate have scooped their nest,<br />
Far hid from the pitiless plunderer's view<br />
In the pathless depths of the parched karroo.
</p>
<p class="stanza">Afar in the desert I love to ride.<br />
With the silent Bush-boy alone by my side,<br />
Away, away, in the wilderness vast<br />
Where the white man's foot hath never passed,<br />
And the quivered Coranna or Bechuan<br />
Hath rarely crossed with his roving clan,&mdash;<br />
A region of emptiness, howling and drear,<br />
Which man hath abandoned from famine and fear;<br />
Which the snake and the lizard inhabit alone,<br />
With the twilight bat from the yawning stone;<br />
Where grass, nor herb, nor shrub takes root,<br />
Save poisonous thorns that pierce the foot;<br />
<a name="Page_225"></a>And the bitter-melon, for food and drink,<br />
Is the pilgrim's fare by the salt lake's brink;<br />
A region of drought, where no river glides,<br />
Nor rippling brook with osiered sides;<br />
Where sedgy pool, nor bubbling fount,<br />
Nor tree, nor cloud, nor misty mount,<br />
Appears, to refresh the aching eye;<br />
But the barren earth and the burning sky,<br />
And the blank horizon, round and round,<br />
Spread,&mdash;void of living sight or sound.<br />
And here, while the night-winds round me sigh,<br />
And the stars burn bright in the midnight sky,<br />
As I sit apart by the desert stone,<br />
Like Elijah at Horeb's cave, alone,<br />
&quot;A still small voice&quot; comes through the wild<br />
(Like a father consoling his fretful child),<br />
Which banishes bitterness, wrath, and fear,<br />
Saying,&mdash;Man is distant, but God is near!

<p class="title"><a name="THE_CHANGED_CROSS"></a>THE CHANGED CROSS.</p>

<p class="stanza">
It was a time of sadness, and my heart,<br />
Although it knew and loved the better part,<br />
Felt wearied with the conflict and the strife,<br />
And all the needful discipline of life.
</p>
<p class="stanza">And while I thought on these, as given to me,<br />
My trial-tests of faith and love to be,<br />
It seemed as if I never could be sure<br />
That faithful to the end I should endure.
</p>
<p class="stanza">And thus, no longer trusting to his might<br />
Who says, &quot;We walk by faith and not by sight,&quot;<br />
Doubting, and almost yielding to despair,<br />
The thought arose, &quot;My cross I cannot bear.
</p>
<p class="stanza">&quot;Far heavier its weight must surely be<br />
Than those of others which I daily see;<br />
Oh! if I might another burden choose,<br />
Methinks I should not fear my crown to lose.&quot;
</p>
<p class="stanza">A solemn silence reigned on all around,<br />
E'en Nature's voices uttered not a sound;<br />
<a name="Page_232"></a>The evening shadows seemed of peace to tell,<br />
And sleep upon my weary spirit fell.
</p>
<p class="stanza">A moment's pause,&mdash;and then a heavenly light<br />
Beamed full upon my wondering, raptured sight;<br />
Angels on silvery wings seemed everywhere,<br />
And angels' music thrilled the balmy air.
</p>
<p class="stanza">Then One, more fair than all the rest to see,<br />
One to whom all the others bowed the knee,<br />
Came gently to me, as I trembling lay,<br />
And, &quot;Follow me,&quot; he said; &quot;I am the Way.&quot;
</p>
<p class="stanza">Then, speaking thus, he led me far above,<br />
And there, beneath a canopy of love,<br />
Crosses of divers shape and size were seen,<br />
Larger and smaller than my own had been.
</p>
<p class="stanza">And one there was, most beauteous to behold,&mdash;<br />
A little one, with jewels set in gold.<br />
&quot;Ah! this,&quot; methought, &quot;I can with comfort wear,<br />
For it will be an easy one to bear.&quot;
</p>
<p class="stanza">And so the little cross I quickly took,<br />
But all at once my frame beneath it shook;<br />
The sparkling jewels, fair were they to <i>see</i>,<br />
But far too heavy was their <i>weight</i> for me.
</p>
<p class="stanza">&quot;This may not be,&quot; I cried, and looked again,<br />
To see if there was any here could ease my pain;<br />
But, one by one, I passed them slowly by,<br />
Till on a lovely one I cast my eye.
</p>
<p class="stanza"><a name="Page_233"></a>Fair flowers around its sculptured form entwined,<br />
And grace and beauty seemed in it combined.<br />
Wondering, I gazed,&mdash;and still I wondered more,<br />
To think so many should have passed it o'er.
</p>
<p class="stanza">But oh! that form so beautiful to see<br />
Soon made its hidden sorrows known to me;<br />
Thorns lay beneath those flowers and colors fair;<br />
Sorrowing, I said, &quot;This cross I may not bear.&quot;
</p>
<p class="stanza">And so it was with each and all around,&mdash;<br />
Not one to suit my <i>need</i> could there be found;<br />
Weeping, I laid each heavy burden down,<br />
As my Guide gently said, &quot;No cross,&mdash;no crown.&quot;
</p>
<p class="stanza">At length to him I raised my saddened heart;<br />
He knew its sorrows, bade its doubts depart;<br />
&quot;Be not afraid,&quot; he said, &quot;but trust in me;<br />
My perfect love shall now be shown to thee.&quot;
</p>
<p class="stanza">And then, with lightened eyes and willing feet,<br />
Again I turned my earthly cross to meet;<br />
With forward footsteps, turning not aside,<br />
For fear some hidden evil might betide;
</p>
<p class="stanza">And there&mdash;in the prepared, appointed way,<br />
Listening to hear, and ready to obey&mdash;<br />
A cross I quickly found of plainest form,<br />
With only words of love inscribed thereon.
</p>
<p class="stanza">With thankfulness I raised it from the rest,<br />
And joyfully acknowledged it the best,<br />
<a name="Page_234"></a>The only one, of all the many there.<br />
That I could feel was good for me to bear.
</p>
<p class="stanza">And, while I thus my chosen one confessed,<br />
I saw a heavenly brightness on it rest;<br />
And as I bent, my burden to sustain,<br />
I recognized <i>my own old cross</i> again.
</p>
<p class="stanza">But oh! how different did it seem to be,<br />
Now I had learned its preciousness to see!<br />
No longer could I unbelieving say<br />
&quot;Perhaps another is a better way.&quot;
</p>
<p class="stanza">Ah, no! henceforth my one desire shall be,<br />
That he who knows me best should choose for me;<br />
And so, whate'er his love sees good to send,<br />
I'll trust it's best,&mdash;because he knows the end.

<p class="stanza">
I was young and &quot;Harry&quot; was strong,<br />
The summer was bursting from sky and plain,<br />
Thrilling our blood as we bounded along,&mdash;<br />
When a picture flashed, and I dropped the rein.
</p>
<p class="stanza">A black sea-creek, with snaky run<br />
Slipping through low green leagues of sedge,<br />
An ebbing tide, and a setting sun;<br />
A hut and a woman by the edge.
</p>
<p class="stanza">Her back was bent and her wool was gray;<br />
The wrinkles lay close on the withered face;<br />
Children were buried and sold away,&mdash;<br />
The Freedom had come to the last of a race!
</p>
<p class="stanza"><a name="Page_240"></a>She lived from a neighbor's hominy-pot;<br />
And praised the Lord, if &quot;the pain&quot; passed by;<br />
From the earthen floor the smoke curled out<br />
Through shingles patched with the bright blue sky.
</p>
<p class="stanza">&quot;Aunt Phillis, you live here all alone?&quot;<br />
I asked, and pitied the gray old head;<br />
Sure as a child, in quiet tone,<br />
&quot;Me and Jesus, Massa,&quot; she said.
</p>
<p class="stanza">I started, for all the place was aglow<br />
With a presence I had not seen before;<br />
The air was full of a music low,<br />
And the Guest Divine stood at the door!
</p>
<p class="stanza">Ay, it was true that the Lord of Life,<br />
Who seeth the widow give her mite,<br />
Had watched this slave in her weary strife,<br />
And shown himself to her longing sight.
</p>
<p class="stanza">The hut and the dirt, the rags and the skin,<br />
The grovelling want and the darkened mind,&mdash;<br />
I looked on this; but the Lord, within:<br />
I would what he saw was in me to find!
</p>
<p class="stanza">A childlike soul, whose faith had force<br />
To see what the angels see in bliss:<br />
She lived, and the Lord lived; so, of course,<br />
They lived together,&mdash;she knew but this.
</p>
<p class="stanza">And the life that I had almost despised<br />
As something to pity, so poor and low,<br />
<a name="Page_241"></a>Had already borne fruit that the Lord so prized<br />
He loved to come near and see it grow.
</p>
<p class="stanza">No sorrow for her that life was done:<br />
A few more days of the hut's unrest,<br />
A little while longer to sit in the sun,&mdash;<br />
Then&mdash;He would be host, and she would be guest!
</p>
<p class="stanza">And up above, if an angel of light<br />
Should stop on his errand of love some day<br />
To ask, &quot;Who lives in the mansion bright?&quot;<br />
&quot;Me and Jesus,&quot; Aunt Phillis will say.
</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p class="stanza">A fancy, foolish and fond, does it seem?<br />
And things are not as Aunt Phillises dream?
</p>
<p class="stanza"><span class="i6">Friend, surely so!</span>
<span class="i6">For this I know,&mdash;</span>
That our faiths are foolish by falling below,<br />
Not coming above, what God will show;<br />
That his commonest thing hides a wonder vast,<br />
To whose beauty our eyes have never passed;<br />
That his face in the present, or in the to-be,<br />
Outshines the best that we think we see.</p>

Precious the love she will bring to bless me,<br />

Love, hope, and joy on her decks are cheering.<br />
Music will welcome her glad appearing.<br />

<p class="stanza">
Far poured past Broadway's lamps alight,<br />
<span class="i2">The tumult of her motley throng.</span>
When high and clear upon the night<br />

To sound of harp and violin;<br />
<span class="i2">A simple but a manly strain,</span>

Courage! courage, mon camarade!

<p class="stanza">
<span class="i2">HAMLET.&mdash;To be, or not to be,&mdash;that is the question</span>
Whether 't is nobler in the mind to suffer<br />
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,<br />
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,<br />
And, by opposing, end them?&mdash;To die, to sleep;&mdash;<br />
No more; and, by a sleep, to say we end<br />
The heart-ache, and the thousand natural shocks<br />
That flesh is heir to,&mdash;'t is a consummation<br />
Devoutly to be wished. To die,&mdash;to sleep;&mdash;<br />
To sleep! perchance to dream:&mdash;ay, there 's the rub;<br />
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come,<br />
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,<br />
Must give us pause: there 's the respect<br />
That makes calamity of so long life;<br />
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,<br />
The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,<br />
The pains of despised love, the law's delay,<br />
The insolence of office, and the spurns<br />
That patient merit of the unworthy takes,<br />
When he himself might his quietus make<br />
With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,<br />
To grunt and sweat under a weary life,<br />
But that the dread of something after death,&mdash;<br />
The undiscovered country, from whose bourn<br />
No traveller returns,&mdash;puzzles the will,<br />
And makes us rather bear those ills we have,<br />
<a name="Page_253"></a>Than fly to others that we know not of?<br />
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;<br />
And thus the native hue of resolution<br />
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought;<br />
And enterprises of great pith and moment,<br />
With this regard, their currents turn awry,<br />
And lose the name of action.

Ere the first day of death is fled,<br />
The first dark day of nothingness,<br />
The last of danger and distress,<br />
(Before Decay's effacing fingers<br />
Have swept the lines where beauty lingers,)<br />
And marked the mild angelic air,<br />
The rapture of repose, that's there,<br />
The fixed yet tender traits that streak<br />
The languor of the placid cheek,<br />

That fires not, wins not, weeps not now,<br />
And but for that chill, changeless brow,<br />
Where cold Obstruction's apathy<br />
Apalls the gazing mourner's heart,<br />
As if to him it could impart<br />
The doom he dreads, yet dwells upon;<br />
Yes, but for these and these alone,<br />
Some moments, ay, one treacherous hour,<br />
<a name="Page_262"></a><span class="i2">He still might doubt the tyrant's power;</span>
<span class="i2">So fair, so calm, so softly sealed,</span>

<span class="i2">'Tis Greece, but living Greece no more!</span>
<span class="i2">So coldly sweet, so deadly fair,</span>

<span class="i2">Hers is the loveliness in death,</span>
<span class="i2">That parts not quite with parting breath;</span>
<span class="i2">But beauty with that fearful bloom,</span>
<span class="i2">That hue which haunts it to the tomb,</span>
<span class="i2">Expression's last receding ray,</span>
<span class="i2">A gilded halo hovering round decay,</span>
<span class="i2">The farewell beam of Feeling past away;</span>
Spark of that flame, perchance of heavenly birth,<br />
Which gleams, but warms no more its cherished earth!

<p class="cmt">[&quot;In the middle of the room, in its white coffin, lay the dead child, the nephew of the poet. Near it, in a great chair, sat Walt Whitman,
surrounded by little ones, and holding a beautiful little girl on his
lap. She looked wonderingly at the spectacle of death, and then
inquiringly into the old man's face. 'You don't know what it is, do you,
my dear?' said he, and added, 'We don't, either.'&quot;]
</p>
<p class="fullst">We know not what it is, dear, this sleep so deep and still;<br />
The folded hands, the awful calm, the cheek so pale and chill;<br />
<a name="Page_263"></a>The lids that will not lift again, though we may call and call;<br />
The strange white solitude of peace that settles over all.
</p>
<p class="fullst">We know not what it means, dear, this desolate heart-pain;<br />
This dread to take our daily way, and walk in it again;<br />
We know not to what other sphere the loved who leave us go,<br />
Nor why we 're left to wonder still, nor why we do not know.
</p>
<p class="fullst">But this we know: Our loved and dead, if they should come this day&mdash;<br />
Should come and ask us, &quot;What is life?&quot; not one of us could say.<br />
Life is a mystery, as deep as ever death can be;<br />
Yet, O, how dear it is to us, this life we live and see!
</p>
<p class="fullst">Then might they say&mdash;these vanished ones&mdash;and blessed is the thought,<br />
&quot;So death is sweet to us, beloved! though we may show you nought;<br />
We may not to the quick reveal the mystery of death&mdash;<br />
Ye cannot tell us, if ye would, the mystery of breath.&quot;
</p>
<p class="fullst">The child who enters life comes not with knowledge or intent,<br />
So those who enter death must go as little children sent.<br />
<a name="Page_264"></a>Nothing is known. But I believe that God is overhead;<br />
And as life is to the living, so death is to the dead.

<p class="stanza">
<span class="i2">To him who, in the love of Nature, holds</span>
Communion with her visible forms, she speaks<br />
A various language: for his gayer hours<br />
She has a voice of gladness, and a smile<br />
And eloquence of beauty; and she glides<br />
Into his darker musings with a mild<br />
And healing sympathy, that steals away<br />
Their sharpness, ere he is aware. When thoughts<br />
Of the last bitter hour come like a blight<br />
Over thy spirit, and sad images<br />
Of the stern agony, and shroud, and pall,<br />
And breathless darkness, and the narrow house,<br />
Make thee to shudder, and grow sick at heart,<br />
Go forth under the open sky, and list<br />
To Nature's teachings, while from all around&mdash;<br />
Earth and her waters, and the depths of air&mdash;<br />
Comes a still voice:&mdash;Yet a few days, and thee<br />
The all-beholding sun shall see no more<br />
In all his course; nor yet in the cold ground,<br />
Where thy pale form was laid, with many tears,<br />
Nor in the embrace of ocean, shall exist<br />
Thy image. Earth, that nourished thee, shall claim<br />
Thy growth, to be resolved to earth again;<br />
<a name="Page_265"></a>And, lost each human trace, surrendering up<br />
Thine individual being, shalt thou go<br />
To mix forever with the elements;<br />
To be a brother to the insensible rock,<br />
And to the sluggish clod, which the rude swain<br />
Turns with his share, and treads upon. The oak<br />
Shall send his roots abroad, and pierce thy mold.<br />
<span class="i2">Yet not to thine eternal resting-place</span>
Shalt thou retire alone,&mdash;nor couldst thou wish<br />
Couch more magnificent. Thou shalt lie down<br />
With patriarchs of the infant world,&mdash;with kings,<br />
The powerful of the earth,&mdash;the wise, the good,<br />
Fair forms, and hoary seers of ages past,<br />
All in one mighty sepulchre. The hills,<br />
Rock-ribbed, and ancient as the sun; the vales<br />
Stretching in pensive quietness between;<br />
The venerable woods; rivers that move<br />
In majesty, and the complaining brooks,<br />
That make the meadows green; and, poured round all,<br />
Old ocean's gray and melancholy waste,&mdash;<br />
Are but the solemn decorations all<br />
Of the great tomb of man! The golden sun,<br />
The planets, all the infinite host of heaven,<br />
Are shining on the sad abodes of death,<br />
Through the still lapse of ages. All that tread<br />
The globe are but a handful to the tribes<br />
That slumber in its bosom. Take the wings<br />
Of morning, pierce the Barcan wilderness,<br />
Or lose thyself in the continuous woods<br />
Where rolls the Oregon, and hears no sound<br />
Save his own dashings,&mdash;yet the dead are there!<br />
And millions in those solitudes, since first<br />
<a name="Page_266"></a>The flight of years began, have laid them down<br />
In their last sleep,&mdash;the dead reign there alone!<br />
So shalt thou rest; and what if thou withdraw<br />
In silence from the living, and no friend<br />
Take note of thy departure? All that breathe<br />
Will share thy destiny. The gay will laugh<br />
When thou art gone, the solemn brood of care<br />
Plod on, and each one, as before, will chase<br />
His favorite phantom; yet all these shall leave<br />
Their mirth and their employments, and shall come<br />
And make their bed with thee. As the long train<br />
Of ages glide away, the sons of men&mdash;<br />
The youth in life's green spring, and he who goes<br />
In the full strength of years, matron and maid,<br />
And the sweet babe, and the gray-headed man&mdash;<br />
Shall, one by one, be gathered to thy side<br />
By those who in their turn shall follow them.<br />
</p>
<p class="stanza"><span class="i2">So live, that when thy summons comes to join</span>
The innumerable caravan that moves<br />
To the pale realms of shade, where each shall take<br />
His chamber in the silent halls of death,<br />
Thou go not, like the quarry-slave at night,<br />
Scourged to his dungeon, but sustained and soothed<br />
By an unfaltering trust, approach thy grave<br />
Like one who wraps the drappery of his conch<br />
About him, and lies down to pleasant dreams.

The snow had begun in the gloaming,<br />

Darling, the merciful Father<br />

<p class="stanza">The morning-glory's blossoming<br />
<span class="i2">Will soon be coming round,&mdash;</span>
We see their rows of heart-shaped leaves<br />

The tender things the winter killed<br />
<span class="i2">Renew again their birth,</span>
<a name="Page_287"></a>But the glory of our morning<br />

Too harsh thy dews, too gross thine air,<br />

But up in groves of Paradise<br />
<span class="i2">Full surely we shall see</span>
Our morning-glory beautiful<br />

But I must gather knots of flowers and buds, and garlands gay;<br />
For I'm to be Queen o' the May, mother, I'm to be Queen o' the May.
</p>
<p class="fullst">As I came up the valley, whom think ye should I see<br />
But Robin leaning on the bridge beneath the hazel-tree?<br />
He thought of that sharp look, mother, I gave him yesterday,&mdash;<br />
But I'm to be Queen o' the May, mother, I'm to be Queen o' the May.
</p>
<p class="fullst">He thought I was a ghost, mother, for I was all in white;<br />
And I ran by him without speaking, like a flash of light.<br />
They call me cruel-hearted, but I care not what they say,<br />
For I'm to be Queen o' the May, mother, I'm to be Queen o' the May.
</p>
<p class="fullst">They say he's dying all for love,&mdash;but that can never be;<br />
<a name="Page_294"></a>They say his heart is breaking, mother,&mdash;what is that to me?<br />
There's many a bolder lad'll woo me any summer day;<br />
And I'm to be Queen o'the May, mother, I'm to be Queen o'the May.
</p>
<p class="fullst">Little Effie shall go with me to-morrow to the green,<br />
And you'll be there, too, mother, to see me made the Queen;<br />
For the shepherd lads on every side'll come from far away;<br />
And I'm to be Queen o'the May, mother, I'm to be Queen o'the May.
</p>
<p class="fullst">The honeysuckle round the porch has woven its wavy bowers,<br />
And by the meadow-trenches blow the faint sweet cuckoo-flowers;<br />
And the wild marsh-marigold shines like fire in swamps and hollows gray;<br />
And I'm to be Queen o'the May, mother, I'm to be Queen o'the May.
</p>
<p class="fullst">The night-winds come and go, mother, upon the meadow-grass,<br />
And the happy stars above them seem to brighten as they pass;<br />
There will not be a drop of rain the whole of the livelong day;<br />
And I'm to be Queen o'the May, mother, I'm to be Queen o'the May.
</p>
<p class="fullst"><a name="Page_295"></a>All the valley, mother, 'll be fresh and green and still,<br />
And the cowslip and the crowfoot are over all the hill,<br />
And the rivulet in the flowery dale'll merrily glance and play,<br />
For I'm to be Queen o'the May, mother, I'm to be Queen o'the May.
</p>
<p class="fullst">So you must wake and call me early, call me early, mother dear;<br />
To-morrow'll be the happiest time of all the glad new-year;<br />
To-morrow'll be of all the year the maddest, merriest day,<br />
For I'm to be Queen o'the May, mother, I'm to be Queen o'the May.
</p>
<p class="subt">NEW YEAR'S EVE.</p>

<p class="fullst">If you're waking, call me early, call me early, mother dear,<br />
For I would see the sun rise upon the glad new-year.<br />
It is the last new-year that I shall ever see,&mdash;<br />
Then you may lay me low i' the mold, and think no more of me.
</p>
<p class="fullst">To-night I saw the sun set,&mdash;he set and left behind<br />
The good old year, the dear old time, and all my peace of mind;<br />
<a name="Page_296"></a>And the new-year's coming up, mother; but I shall never see<br />
The blossom on the blackthorn, the leaf upon the tree.
</p>
<p class="fullst">Last May we made a crown of flowers; we had a merry day,&mdash;<br />
Beneath the hawthorn on the green they made me Queen of May;<br />
And we danced about the May-pole and in the hazel copse,<br />
Till Charles's Wain came out above the tall white chimney-tops.
</p>
<p class="fullst">There's not a flower on all the hills,&mdash;the frost is on the pane;<br />
I only wish to live till the snowdrops come again.<br />
I wish the snow would melt and the sun come out on high,&mdash;<br />
I long to see a flower so before the day I die.
</p>
<p class="fullst">The building-rook'll caw from the windy tall elm-tree,<br />
And the tufted plover pipe along the fallow lea,<br />
And the swallow'll come back again with summer o'er the wave,<br />
But I shall lie alone, mother, within the moldering grave.
</p>
<p class="fullst">Upon the chancel casement, and upon that grave of mine,<br />
In the early, early morning the summer sun'll shine,<br />
<a name="Page_297"></a>Before the red cock crows from the farm upon the hill,&mdash;<br />
When you are warm-asleep, mother, and all the world is still.
</p>
<p class="fullst">When the flowers come again, mother, beneath the waning light<br />
You'll never see me more in the long gray fields at night;<br />
When from the dry dark wold the summer airs blow cool<br />
On the oat-grass and the sword-grass, and the bulrush in the pool.
</p>
<p class="fullst">You'll bury me, my mother, just beneath the hawthorn shade,<br />
And you'll come sometimes and see me where I am lowly laid.<br />
I shall not forget you, mother; I shall hear you when you pass,<br />
With your feet above my head in the long and pleasant grass.
</p>
<p class="fullst">I have been wild and wayward, but you'll forgive me now;<br />
You'll kiss me, my own mother, upon my cheek and brow;<br />
Nay, nay, you must not weep, nor let your grief be wild;<br />
You should not fret for me, mother&mdash;you have another child.
</p>
<p class="fullst"><a name="Page_298"></a>If I can, I'll come again, mother, from out my resting-place;<br />
Though you'll not see me, mother, I shall look upon your face;<br />
Though I cannot speak a word, I shall harken what you say.<br />
And be often, often with you when you think I'm far away.
</p>
<p class="fullst">Good night! good night! when I have said good night forevermore,<br />
And you see me carried out from the threshold of the door,<br />
Don't let Effie come to see me till my grave be growing green,&mdash;<br />
She'll be a better child to you than ever I have been.
</p>
<p class="fullst">She'll find my garden tools upon the granary floor.<br />
Let her take 'em&mdash;they are hers; I shall never garden more.<br />
But tell her, when I'm gone, to train the rosebush that I set<br />
About the parlor window and the box of mignonette.
</p>
<p class="fullst">Good night, sweet-mother! Call me before the day is born.<br />
All night I lie awake, but I fall asleep at morn;<br />
But I would see the sun rise upon the glad new-year,&mdash;<br />
So, if you're waking, call me, call me early, mother dear.
</p>
<p class="subt"><a name="Page_299"></a>CONCLUSION.</p>

<p class="fullst">I thought to pass away before, and yet alive I am;<br />
And in the fields all around I hear the bleating of the lamb.<br />
How sadly, I remember, rose the morning of the year!<br />
To die before the snowdrop came, and now the violet's here.
</p>
<p class="fullst">O, sweet is the new violet, that comes beneath the skies;<br />
And sweeter is the young lamb's voice to me that cannot rise;<br />
And sweet is all the land about, and all the flowers that blow;<br />
And sweeter far is death than life, to me that long to go.
</p>
<p class="fullst">It seemed so hard at first, mother, to leave the blessed sun,<br />
And now it seems as hard to stay; and yet, His will be done!<br />
But still I think it can't be long before I find release;<br />
And that good man, the clergyman, has told me words of peace.
</p>
<p class="fullst">O, blessings on his kindly voice, and on his silver hair,<br />
And blessings on his whole life long, until he meet me there!<br />
<a name="Page_300"></a>O, blessings on his kindly heart and on his silver head!<br />
A thousand times I blest him, as he knelt beside my bed.
</p>
<p class="fullst">He taught me all the mercy, for he showed me all the sin;<br />
Now, though my lamp was lighted late, there's One will let me in.<br />
Nor would I now be well, mother, again, if that could be;<br />
For my desire is but to pass to Him that died for me.
</p>
<p class="fullst">I did not hear the dog howl, mother, or the death-watch beat,&mdash;<br />
There came a sweeter token when the night and morning meet;<br />
But sit beside my bed, mother, and put your hand in mine,<br />
And Effie on the other side, and I will tell the sign.
</p>
<p class="fullst">All in the wild March-morning I heard the angels call,&mdash;<br />
It was when the moon was setting, and the dark was over all;<br />
The trees began to whisper, and the wind began to roll,<br />
And in the wild March-morning I heard them call my soul.
</p>
<p class="fullst">For, lying broad awake, I thought of you and Effie dear;<br />
<a name="Page_301"></a>I saw you sitting in the house, and I no longer here;<br />
With all my strength I prayed for both,&mdash;and so I felt resigned,<br />
And up the valley came a swell of music on the wind.
</p>
<p class="fullst">I thought that it was fancy, and I listened in my bed;<br />
And then did something speak to me,&mdash;I know not what was said;<br />
For great delight and shuddering took hold of all my mind,<br />
And up the valley came again the music on the wind.
</p>
<p class="fullst">But you were sleeping; and I said, &quot;It's not for them,&mdash;it's mine;&quot;<br />
And if it comes three times, I thought, I take it for a sign.<br />
And once again it came, and close beside the window-bars;<br />
Then seemed to go right up to heaven and die among the stars.
</p>
<p class="fullst">So now I think my time is near; I trust it is. I know<br />
The bless&egrave;d music went that way my soul will have to go.<br />
And for myself, indeed, I care not if I go to-day;<br />
But Effie, you must comfort <i>her</i> when I am past away.
</p>
<p class="fullst"><a name="Page_302"></a>
And say to Robin a kind word, and tell him not to fret;<br />
There's many a worthier than I, would make him happy yet.<br />
If I had lived&mdash;I cannot tell&mdash;I might have been his wife;<br />
But all these things have ceased to be, with my desire of life.
</p>
<p class="fullst">O, look! the sun begins to rise! the heavens are in a glow;<br />
He shines upon a hundred fields, and all of them I know.<br />
And there I move no longer now, and there his light may shine,&mdash;<br />
Wild flowers in the valley for other hands than mine.
</p>
<p class="fullst">O, sweet and strange it seems to me, that ere this day is done<br />
The voice that now is speaking may be beyond the sun,&mdash;<br />
Forever and forever with those just souls and true,&mdash;<br />
And what is life, that we should moan? why make we such ado?
</p>
<p class="fullst">Forever and forever, all in a bless&egrave;d home,&mdash;<br />
And there to wait a little while till you and Effie come,&mdash;<br />
To lie within the light of God, as I lie upon your breast,&mdash;<br />
And the wicked cease from troubling, and the weary are at rest.

Yet one thing&mdash;one&mdash;in my soul's full scope,<br />
<span class="i2">Either I missed or itself missed me,&mdash;</span>
And I want and find you, Evelyn Hope!<br />
<span class="i2">What is the issue? let us see!</span>
</p>
<p class="stanza">I loved you, Evelyn, all the while;<br />
<span class="i2">My heart seemed full as it could hold,&mdash;</span>
There was place and to spare for the frank young smile,<br />
<span class="i2">And the red young mouth, and the hair's young gold.</span>
So, hush! I will give you this leaf to keep;<br />
<span class="i2">See, I shut it inside the sweet, cold hand.</span>
There, that is our secret! go to sleep;<br />
<span class="i2">You will wake, and remember, and understand.</span>

<p class="title"><a name="ANNABEL_LEE"></a>ANNABEL LEE.</p>

<p class="stanza">
It was many and many a year ago,<br />
<span class="i2">In a kingdom by the sea,</span>
<a name="Page_313"></a>That a maiden lived, whom you may know<br />
<span class="i2">By the name of Annabel Lee;</span>
And this maiden she lived with no other thought<br />
<span class="i2">Than to love, and be loved by me.</span>
</p>
<p class="stanza">I was a child and she was a child,<br />
<span class="i2">In this kingdom by the sea;</span>
But we loved with a love that was more than love,<br />
<span class="i2">I and my Annabel Lee,&mdash;</span>
With a love that the winged seraphs of heaven<br />
<span class="i2">Coveted her and me.</span>
</p>
<p class="stanza">And this was the reason that long ago,<br />
<span class="i2">In this kingdom by the sea,</span>
A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling<br />
<span class="i2">My beautiful Annabel Lee;</span>
So that her high-born kinsmen came,<br />
<span class="i2">And bore her away from me,</span>
To shut her up in a sepulchre,<br />
<span class="i2">In this kingdom by the sea.</span>
</p>
<p class="stanza">The angels, not so happy in heaven,<br />
<span class="i2">Went envying her and me.</span>
Yes! that was the reason (as all men know)<br />
<span class="i2">In this kingdom by the sea,</span>
That the wind came out of the cloud by night,<br />
<span class="i2">Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.</span>
</p>
<p class="stanza">But our love it was stronger by far than the love<br />
<span class="i2">Of those who were older than we,</span>
<span class="i2">Of many far wiser than we;</span>
<a name="Page_314"></a>And neither the angels in heaven above,<br />
<span class="i2">Nor the demons down under the sea,</span>
Can ever dissever my soul from the soul<br />
<span class="i2">Of the beautiful Annabel Lee.</span>
</p>
<p class="stanza">For the moon never beams without bringing me dreams<br />
<span class="i2">Of the beautiful Annabel Lee,</span>
And the stars never rise but I feel the bright eyes<br />
<span class="i2">Of the beautiful Annabel Lee.</span>
And so, all the night-tide I lie down by the side<br />
Of my darling, my darling, my life, and my bride,<br />
<span class="i2">In her sepulchre there by the sea,</span>
<span class="i2">In her tomb by the sounding sea.</span>

Thy braes were bonny, Yarrow stream!<br />

<p class="stanza">Forever now, O Yarrow stream!<br />
<span class="i2">Thou art to me a stream of sorrow;</span>

</p>
<p class="stanza">He promised me a milk-white steed,<br />

He promised me a little page,
<span class="i2">To 'squire me to his father's towers;</span>
<a name="Page_315"></a>He promised me a wedding-ring,&mdash;<br />
<span class="i2">The wedding-day was fixed to-morrow;</span>
Now he is wedded to his grave,<br />
<span class="i2">Alas, his watery grave, in Yarrow!</span>
</p>
<p class="stanza">Sweet were his words when last we met;<br />
<span class="i2">My passion I as freely told him!</span>
Clasped in his arms, I little thought<br />
<span class="i2">That I should nevermore behold him!</span>
Scarce was he gone, I saw his ghost;<br />
<span class="i2">It vanished with a shriek of sorrow;</span>
Thrice did the water-wraith ascend,<br />
<span class="i2">And gave a doleful groan through Yarrow.</span>
</p>
<p class="stanza">His mother from the window looked<br />
<span class="i2">With all the longing of a mother;</span>
His little sister weeping walked<br />
<span class="i2">The greenwood path to meet her brother.</span>
They sought him east, they sought him west,<br />
<span class="i2">They sought him all the forest thorough,</span>
They only saw the cloud of night,<br />
<span class="i2">They only heard the roar of Yarrow!</span>
</p>
<p class="stanza">No longer from thy window look,<br />
<span class="i2">Thou hast no son, thou tender mother!</span>
No longer walk, thou lovely maid;<br />
<span class="i2">Alas, thou hast no more a brother!</span>
No longer seek him east or west,<br />
<span class="i2">And search no more the forest thorough;</span>
For, wandering in the night so dark,<br />
<span class="i2">He fell a lifeless corse in Yarrow.</span>
</p>
<p class="stanza">The tear shall never leave my cheek,<br />
<span class="i2">No other youth shall be my marrow;</span>
<a name="Page_316"></a>I'll seek thy body in the stream,<br />
<span class="i2">And then with thee I'll sleep in Yarrow.</span>

<p class="title"><a name="THE_DEATH_OF_MINNEHAHA"></a>THE DEATH OF MINNEHAHA.</p>
<p class="subt">FROM &quot;THE SONG OF HIAWATHA.&quot;</p>

<p class="stanza">
All day long roved Hiawatha<br />
In that melancholy forest,<br />
Through the shadows of whose thickets,<br />
In the pleasant days of Summer,<br />
<a name="Page_320"></a>Of that ne'er forgotten Summer.<br />
He had brought his young wife homeward<br />
From the land of the Dacotahs;<br />
When the birds sang in the thickets,<br />
And the streamlets laughed and glistened,<br />
And the air was full of fragrance,<br />
And the lovely Laughing Water<br />
Said with voice that did not tremble,<br />
&quot;I will follow you, my husband!&quot;<br />
<span class="i2">In the wigwam with Nokomis,</span>
With those gloomy guests that watched her,<br />
With the Famine and the Fever,<br />
She was lying, the Beloved,<br />
She, the dying Minnehaha.<br />
<span class="i2">&quot;Hark!&quot; she said; &quot;I hear a rushing,</span>
Hear a roaring and a rushing,<br />
Hear the Falls of Minnehaha<br />
Calling to me from a distance!&quot;<br />
&quot;No, my child!&quot; said old Nokomis,<br />
&quot;'T is the night-wind in the pine-trees!&quot;<br />
<span class="i2">&quot;Look!&quot; she said; &quot;I see my father</span>
Standing lonely at his doorway.<br />
Beckoning to me from his wigwam<br />
In the land of the Dacotahs!&quot;<br />
&quot;No, my child!&quot; said old Nokomis,<br />
&quot;'T is the smoke, that waves and beckons!&quot;<br />
<span class="i2">&quot;Ah!&quot; said she, &quot;the eyes of Panguk</span>
Glare upon me in the darkness,<br />
I can feel his icy fingers<br />
Clasping mine amid the darkness!<br />
Hiawatha! Hiawatha!&quot;<br />
<span class="i2">And the desolate Hiawatha,</span>
Far away amid the forest,<br />
<a name="Page_321"></a>Miles away among the mountains,<br />
Heard that sudden cry of anguish,<br />
Heard the voice of Minnehaha<br />
Calling to him in the darkness,<br />
&quot;Hiawatha! Hiawatha!&quot;<br />
<span class="i2">Over snow-fields waste and pathless,</span>
Under snow-encumbered branches,<br />
Homeward hurried Hiawatha,<br />
Empty-handed, heavy-hearted,<br />
Heard Nokomis moaning, wailing:<br />
&quot;Wahonowin! Wahonowin!<br />
Would that I had perished for you,<br />
Would that I were dead as you are!<br />
Wahonowin! Wahonowin!&quot;<br />

<span class="i2">And he rushed into the wigwam,</span>
Saw the old Nokomis slowly<br />
Rocking to and fro and moaning,<br />
Saw his lovely Minnehaha<br />
Lying dead and cold before him,<br />
And his bursting heart within him<br />
Uttered such a cry of anguish,<br />
That the forest moaned and shuddered,<br />
That the very stars in heaven<br />
Shook and trembled with his anguish.<br />

<span class="i2">Then he sat down, still and speechless,</span>
On the bed of Minnehaha,<br />
At the feet of Laughing Water,<br />
At those willing feet, that never<br />
More would lightly run to meet him,<br />
Never more would lightly follow.<br />

<span class="i2">With both hands his face he covered,</span>
Seven long days and nights he sat there,<br />
As if in a swoon he sat there,<br />
<a name="Page_322"></a>Speechless, motionless, unconscious<br />
Of the daylight or the darkness.<br />
<span class="i2">Then they buried Minnehaha;</span>
In the snow a grave they made her,<br />
In the forest deep and darksome,<br />
Underneath the moaning hemlocks;<br />
Clothed her in her richest garments,<br />
Wrapped her in her robes of ermine,<br />
Covered her with snow, like ermine;<br />
Thus they buried Minnehaha.<br />

<span class="i2">And at night a fire was lighted,</span>
On her grave four times was kindled,<br />
For her soul upon its journey<br />
To the Islands of the Blessed.<br />
From his doorway Hiawatha<br />
Saw it burning in the forest,<br />
Lighting up the gloomy hemlocks;<br />
From his sleepless bed uprising,<br />
From the bed of Minnehaha,<br />
Stood and watched it at the doorway,<br />
That it might not be extinguished,<br />
Might not leave her in the darkness.<br />

<span class="i2">&quot;Farewell!&quot; said he, &quot;Minnehaha!</span>
Farewell, O my Laughing Water!<br />
All my heart is buried with you,<br />
All my thoughts go onward with you,<br />
Come not back again to labor,<br />
Come not back again to suffer,<br />
Where the Famine and the Fever<br />
Wear the heart and waste the body.<br />
Soon my task will be completed,<br />
Soon your footsteps I shall follow<br />
To the Islands of the Bless&egrave;d,<br />
<a name="Page_323"></a>To the Kingdom of Ponemah,<br />
To the Land of the Hereafter!&quot;

<p class="title"><a name="MOTHER_AND_POET"></a>MOTHER AND POET.</p>
<p class="subt">TURIN,&mdash;AFTER NEWS FROM GAETA, 1861.</p>
<p class="cmt">Laura Savio of Turin, a poetess and patriot, whose sons were
killed at Ancona and Ga&euml;ta.</p>

<p class="stanza">Dead! one of them shot by the sea in the east,<br />
<span class="i2">And one of them shot in the west by the sea.</span>
Dead! both my boys! When you sit at the feast,<br />
<span class="i2">And are wanting a great song for Italy free,</span>
<span class="i4">Let none look at me!</span>
</p>
<p class="stanza">Yet I was a poetess only last year,<br />
<span class="i2">And good at my art, for a woman, men said.</span>
But this woman, this, who is agonized here,<br />
<span class="i2">The east sea and west sea rhyme on in her head</span>
<span class="i4">Forever instead.</span>
</p>
<p class="stanza">What art can a woman be good at? O, vain!<br />
<span class="i2">What art is she good at, but hurting her breast</span>
With the milk teeth of babes, and a smile at the pain?<br />
<span class="i2">Ah, boys, how you hurt! you were strong as you pressed,</span>
<span class="i4">And I proud by that test.</span>
</p>
<p class="stanza">What art's for a woman! To hold on her knees<br />
<span class="i2">Both darlings! to feel all their arms round her throat</span>
<a name="Page_324"></a>Cling, struggle a little! to sew by degrees<br />
<span class="i2">And 'broider the long-clothes and neat little coat!</span>
<span class="i6">To dream and to dote.</span>
</p>
<p class="stanza">To teach them ... It stings there. I made them indeed<br />
<span class="i2">Speak plain the word &quot;country,&quot; I taught them, no doubt,</span>
That a country 's a thing men should die for at need.<br />
<span class="i2">I prated of liberty, rights, and about</span>
<span class="i6">The tyrant turned out.</span>
</p>
<p class="stanza">And when their eyes flashed ... O my beautiful eyes! ...<br />
<span class="i2">I exulted! nay, let them go forth at the wheels</span>
Of the guns, and denied not.&mdash;But then the surprise,<br />
<span class="i2">When one sits quite alone!&mdash;Then one weeps, then one kneels!</span>
<span class="i6">&mdash;God! how the house feels!</span>
</p>
<p class="stanza">At first happy news came, in gay letters moiled<br />
<span class="i2">With my kisses, of camp-life and glory, and how</span>
They both loved me, and soon, coming home to be spoiled,<br />
<span class="i2">In return would fan off every fly from my brow</span>
<span class="i6">With their green laurel-bough.</span>
</p>
<p class="stanza">Then was triumph at Turin. &quot;Ancona was free!&quot;<br />
<span class="i2">And some one came out of the cheers in the street</span>
<a name="Page_325"></a>With a face pale as stone, to say something to me.<br />
&mdash;My Guido was dead!&mdash;I fell down at his feet,<br />
<span class="i4">While they cheered in the street.</span>
</p>
<p class="stanza">I bore it;&mdash;friends soothed me: my grief looked sublime<br />
<span class="i2">As the ransom of Italy. One boy remained</span>
To be leant on and walked with, recalling the time<br />
<span class="i2">When the first grew immortal, while both of us strained</span>
<span class="i4">To the height he had gained.</span>
</p>
<p class="stanza">And letters still came,&mdash;shorter, sadder, more strong,<br />
<span class="i2">Writ now but in one hand. &quot;I was not to faint.</span>
One loved me for two ... would be with me ere-long:<br />
<span class="i2">And 'Viva Italia' he died for, our saint,</span>
<span class="i4">Who forbids our complaint.&quot;</span>
</p>
<p class="stanza">My Nanni would add &quot;he was safe, and aware<br />
<span class="i2">Of a presence that turned off the balls ... was imprest</span>
It was Guido himself, who knew what I could bear,<br />
<span class="i2">And how 't was impossible, quite dispossessed,</span>
<span class="i4">To live on for the rest.&quot;</span>
</p>
<p class="stanza">On which without pause up the telegraph line<br />
<span class="i2">Swept smoothly the next news from Ga&euml;ta:&mdash;&quot;Shot.</span>
<a name="Page_326"></a>Tell his mother.&quot; Ah, ah, &quot;his,&quot; &quot;their&quot; mother; not &quot;mine.&quot;<br />
<span class="i2">No voice says &quot;my mother&quot; again to me. What!</span>
<span class="i4">You think Guido forgot?</span>
</p>
<p class="stanza">Are souls straight so happy that, dizzy with heaven,<br />
<span class="i2">They drop earth's affections, conceive not of woe?</span>
I think not. Themselves were too lately forgiven<br />
<span class="i2">Through that love and sorrow which reconciled so</span>
<span class="i4">The above and below.</span>
</p>
<p class="stanza">O Christ of the seven wounds, who look'dst through the dark<br />
<span class="i2">To the face of thy mother! consider, I pray.</span>
How we common mothers stand desolate, mark,<br />
<span class="i2">Whose sons, not being Christs, die with eyes turned away,</span>
<span class="i4">And no last word to say!</span>
</p>
<p class="stanza">Both boys dead! but that's out of nature. We all<br />
<span class="i2">Have been patriots, yet each house must always keep one.</span>
'T were imbecile hewing out roads to a wall.<br />
<span class="i2">And when Italy's made, for what end is it done</span>
<span class="i4">If we have not a son?</span>
</p>
<p class="stanza">Ah, ah, ah! when Ga&euml;ta's taken, what then?<br />
<span class="i2">When the fair wicked queen sits no more at her sport</span>
<a name="Page_327"></a>Of the fire-balls of death crashing souls out of men?<br />
<span class="i2">When your guns at Cavalli with final retort</span>
<span class="i4">Have cut the game short,&mdash;</span>
</p>
<p class="stanza">When Venice and Rome keep their new jubilee,<br />
<span class="i2">When your flag takes all heaven for its white, green, and red,</span>
When you have your country from mountain to sea,<br />
<span class="i2">When King Victor has Italy's crown on his head,</span>
<span class="i6">(And I have my dead,)</span>
</p>
<p class="stanza">What then? Do not mock me. Ah, ring your bells low,<br />
<span class="i2">And burn your lights faintly!&mdash;My country is there,</span>
Above the star pricked by the last peak of snow,<br />
<span class="i2">My Italy's there,&mdash;with my brave civic pair,</span>
<span class="i6">To disfranchise despair.</span>
</p>
<p class="stanza">Forgive me. Some women bear children in strength,<br />
<span class="i2">And bite back the cry of their pain in self-scorn.</span>
But the birth-pangs of nations will wring us at length<br />
<span class="i2">Into such wail as this!&mdash;and we sit on forlorn</span>
<span class="i6">When the man-child is born.</span>
</p>
<p class="stanza">Dead! one of them shot by the sea in the west,<br />
<span class="i2">And one of them shot in the east by the sea!</span>
<a name="Page_328"></a>Both! both my boys!&mdash;If in keeping the feast<br />

The delight of low replies.
</p>
<p class="stanza">'Tis a morning pure and sweet,<br />

<p class="stanza">Would the happy spirit descend<br />
<span class="i2">From the realms of light and song,</span>

<span class="i2">As she looks among the blest,</span>
Should I fear to greet my friend<br />

Or to ask her, &quot;Take me, sweet,<br />
<span class="i2">To the regions of thy rest?&quot;</span>

<p class="stanza">But the broad light glares and beats,<br />
And the shadow flits and Meets<br />
<span class="i2">And will not let me be;</span>
And I loathe the squares and streets,<br />
<a name="Page_335"></a>And the faces that one meets,<br />
<span class="i2">Hearts with no love for me;</span>
Always I long to creep<br />
Into some still cavern deep,<br />
There to weep, and weep, and weep<br />
<span class="i2">My whole soul out to thee.</span>

Before they laid it in its resting-place,<br />
And deem that death had left it almost fair;<br />

And fold my hands with lingering caress&mdash;<br />
Poor hands, so empty and so cold to-night!

Errands on which the willing feet had sped;<br />
The memory of my selfishness and pride,<br />

And so I should be loved and mourned to-night.

<p class="stanza"><span class="i8">If I should die to-night,</span>
Even hearts estranged would turn once more to me,<br />
Recalling other days remorsefully;<br />
The eyes that chill me with averted glance<br />
Would look upon me as of yore, perchance,<br />
And soften, in the old familiar way;<br />
For who could war with dumb, unconscious clay?<br />
So I might rest, forgiven of all, to-night.

<p class="stanza"><span class="i8">Oh, friends, I pray to-night,</span>
Keep not your kisses for my dead, cold brow&mdash;<br />
The way is lonely; let me feel them now.<br />
Think gently of me; I am travel-worn;<br />
My faltering feet are pierced with many a thorn.<br />
Forgive, oh, hearts estranged, forgive, I plead!<br />
When dreamless rest is mine I shall not need<br />
The tenderness for which I long to-night.

<p class="stanza">I would not live alway&mdash;live alway below!<br />
Oh no, I'll not linger when bidden to go:<br />
The days of our pilgrimage granted us here<br />
Are enough for life's woes, full enough for its cheer:<br />
Would I shrink from the path which the prophets of God,<br />
Apostles, and martyrs, so joyfully trod?<br />
Like a spirit unblest, o'er the earth would I roam,<br />
While brethren and friends are all hastening home?

Where storm after storm rises dark o'er the way;<br />
Where seeking for rest we but hover around,<br />

Where Hope, when she paints her gay bow in the air.<br />
Leaves its brilliance to fade in the night of despair,<br />
And joy's fleeting angel ne'er sheds a glad ray,<br />
Save the gleam of the plumage that bears him away.
</p>
<p class="stanza">I would not live alway&mdash;thus fettered by sin,<br />
Temptation without and corruption within;<br />
In a moment of strength if I sever the chain,<br />
Scarce the victory's mine, ere I 'm captive again;<br />

<p class="stanza">I would not live alway&mdash;no, welcome the tomb,<br />
Since Jesus hath lain there I dread not its gloom;<br />
Where he deigned to sleep, I'll too bow my head,<br />
All peaceful to slumber on that hallowed bed.<br />
Then the glorious daybreak, to follow that night,<br />
The orient gleam of the angels of light,<br />
With their clarion call for the sleepers to rise.<br />
And chant forth their matins, away to the skies.

<p class="stanza">Who, who would live alway? away from his God,<br />
Away from yon heaven, that blissful abode,<br />

And the noontide of glory eternally reigns;<br />
Where the saints of all ages in harmony meet,<br />
Their Saviour and brethren transported to greet,<br />
While the songs of salvation exultingly roll<br />
And the smile of the Lord is the feast of the soul.
</p>
<p class="stanza">That heavenly music! what is it I hear?<br />
The notes of the harpers ring sweet in mine ear!<br />
And see, soft unfolding those portals of gold,<br />
The King all arrayed in his beauty behold!<br />
Oh give me, oh give me, the wings of a dove,<br />
To adore him&mdash;be near him&mdash;enwrapt with his love;<br />

<p class="stanza">In the best chamber of the house,<br />
<span class="i2">Shut up in dim, uncertain light,</span>
There stood an antique chest of drawers,<br />
<span class="i2">Of foreign wood, with brasses bright.</span>
One day a woman, frail and gray,<br />

&quot;Let in,&quot; said she, &quot;the light of day,<br />

<span class="i2">Knelt down with eager, curious face;</span>
Perchance she dreamt of Indian silks,<br />

But when the summer sunshine fell<br />

Leaning upon her staff, she gazed<br />

A little frock of finest lawn;<br />
<span class="i2">A hat with tiny bows of blue;</span>

&quot;But now it seems so good to know<br />

Dear Jean, we see with clearer sight<br />

There's one with ringlets of sunny gold,<br />

He crossed in the twilight gray and cold,<br />

And lo! they have passed from our yearning hearts,<br />
<span class="i2">They cross the stream and are gone for aye.</span>
We may not sunder the veil apart<br />
<span class="i2">That hides from our vision the gates of day;</span>
We only know that their barks no more<br />
<span class="i2">May sail with us o'er life's stormy sea;</span>
Yet somewhere, I know, on the unseen shore,<br />
<span class="i2">They watch, and beckon, and wait for me.</span>
</p>
<p class="stanza">
And I sit and think, when the sunset's gold<br />
<span class="i2">Is flushing river and hill and shore,</span>
I shall one day stand by the water cold,<br />
<span class="i2">And list for the sound of the boatman's oar;</span>
I shall watch for a gleam of the flapping sail,<br />
<span class="i2">I shall hear the boat as it gains the strand,</span>
<a name="Page_408"></a>I shall pass from sight with the boatman pale,<br />
<span class="i2">To the better shore of the spirit land.</span>
I shall know the loved who have gone before,<br />

<div class="poem"><p class="title"><a name="FOR_CHARLIES_SAKE"></a>FOR CHARLIE'S SAKE.</p>

<p class="stanza">The night is late, the house is still;<br />
The angels of the hour fulfil<br />
Their tender ministries, and move<br />
From couch to couch in cares of love.<br />
They drop into thy dreams, sweet wife,<br />
The happiest smile of Charlie's life,<br />
And lay on baby's lips a kiss,<br />
Fresh from his angel-brother's bliss;<br />
And, as they pass, they seem to make<br />
A strange, dim hymn, &quot;For Charlie's sake.&quot;
</p>
<p class="stanza">My listening heart takes up the strain,<br />
And gives it to the night again,<br />
Fitted with words of lowly praise,<br />
And patience learned of mournful days,<br />
And memories of the dead child's ways.<br />
His will be done, His will be done!<br />
Who gave and took away my son,<br />
In &quot;the far land&quot; to shine and sing<br />
Before the Beautiful, the King,<br />
Who every day does Christmas make,<br />
All starred and belled for Charlie's sake.
</p>
<p class="stanza">For Charlie's sake I will arise;<br />
I will anoint me where he lies,<br />
And change my raiment, and go in<br />
To the Lord's house, and leave my sin<br />
<a name="Page_412"></a>Without, and seat me at his board,<br />
Eat, and be glad, and praise the Lord.<br />
For wherefore should I fast and weep,<br />
And sullen moods of mourning keep?<br />
I cannot bring him back, nor he,<br />
For any calling, come to me.<br />
The bond the angel Death did sign,<br />
God sealed&mdash;for Charlie's sake, and mine.
</p>
<p class="stanza">I'm very poor&mdash;this slender stone<br />
Marks all the narrow field I own;<br />
Yet, patient husbandman, I till<br />
With faith and prayers, that precious hill,<br />
Sow it with penitential pains,<br />
And, hopeful, wait the latter rains;<br />
Content if, after all, the spot<br />
Yield barely one forget-me-not&mdash;<br />
Whether or figs or thistle make<br />
My crop content for Charlie's sake.
</p>
<p class="stanza">I have no houses, builded well&mdash;<br />
Only that little lonesome cell,<br />
Where never romping playmates come,<br />
Nor bashful sweethearts, cunning-dumb&mdash;<br />
An April burst of girls and boys,<br />
Their rainbowed cloud of glooms and joys<br />
Born with their songs, gone with their toys;<br />
Nor ever is its stillness stirred<br />
By purr of cat, or chirp of bird,<br />
Or mother's twilight legend, told<br />
Of Horner's pie, or Tiddler's gold,<br />
Or fairy hobbling to the door,<br />
Red-cloaked and weird, banned and poor,<br />
<a name="Page_413"></a>To bless the good child's gracious eyes,<br />
The good child's wistful charities,<br />
And crippled changeling's hunch to make<br />
Dance on his crutch, for good child's sake.
</p>
<p class="stanza">How is it with the child? 'Tis well;<br />
Nor would I any miracle<br />
Might stir my sleeper's tranquil trance,<br />
Or plague his painless countenance:<br />
I would not any seer might place<br />
His staff on my immortal's face.<br />
Or lip to lip, and eye to eye,<br />
Charm back his pale mortality.<br />
No, Shunamite! I would not break<br />
God's stillness. Let them weep who wake.
</p>
<p class="stanza">For Charlie's sake my lot is blest:<br />
No comfort like his mother's breast,<br />
No praise like hers; no charm expressed<br />
In fairest forms hath half her zest.<br />
For Charlie's sake this bird's caressed<br />
That death left lonely in the nest;<br />
For Charlie's sake my heart is dressed,<br />
As for its birthday, in its best;<br />
For Charlie's sake we leave the rest.<br />
To Him who gave, and who did take,<br />
And saved us twice, for Charlie's sake.

<p class="stanza">In the fair gardens of celestial peace<br />
<span class="i2">Walketh a gardener in meekness clad;</span>
Fair are the flowers that wreathe his dewy locks,<br />
<span class="i2">And his mysterious eyes are sweet and sad.</span>
</p>
<p class="stanza">
Fair are the silent foldings of his robes,<br />
<span class="i2">Falling with saintly calmness to his feet;</span>
And when he walks, each floweret to his will<br />
<span class="i2">With living pulse of sweet accord doth beat.</span>
</p>
<p class="stanza">
Every green leaf thrills to its tender heart,<br />
<span class="i2">In the mild summer radiance of his eye;</span>
No fear of storm, or cold, or bitter frost,<br />

<p class="stanza"><a name="Page_427"></a>
And all our pleasant haunts of earthly love<br />

</p>
<p class="stanza">
We call them ours, o'erwept with selfish tears,<br />

<p class="stanza">
But when some sunny spot in those bright fields<br />
<span class="i2">Needs the fair presence of an added flower,</span>
Down sweeps a starry angel in the night:<br />
<span class="i2">At morn the rose has vanished from our bower.</span>
</p>
<p class="stanza">
Where stood our tree, our flower, there is a grave!<br />
<span class="i2">Blank, silent, vacant; but in worlds above,</span>
Like a new star outblossomed in the skies,<br />
<span class="i2">The angels hail an added flower of love.</span>
</p>
<p class="stanza">
Dear friend, no more upon that lonely mound,<br />
<span class="i2">Strewed with the red and yellow autumn leaf,</span>
Drop thou the tear, but raise the fainting eye<br />
<span class="i2">Beyond the autumn mists of earthly grief.</span>
</p>
<p class="stanza">
Thy garden rosebud bore within its breast<br />
<span class="i2">Those mysteries of color, warm and bright,</span>
That the bleak climate of this lower sphere<br />
<span class="i2">Could never waken into form and light.</span>
</p>
<p class="stanza">
Yes, the sweet Gardener hath borne her hence,<br />
<span class="i2">Nor must thou ask to take her thence away;</span>
<a name="Page_428"></a>Thou shalt behold her, in some coming hour,<br />
<span class="i2">Full blossomed in his fields of cloudless day.</span>

<span class="i6">Into a field,</span>
Where I sometimes had seen the soil to yield<br />

Many a question intricate and rare<br />

<span class="i6">A simple name alone,</span>
<span class="i6">To the great world unknown,</span>
<a name="Page_443"></a>Is graven here, and wild flowers, rising round,<br />
Meek meadow-sweet and violets of the ground,<br />
<span class="i2">Lean lovingly against the humble stone.</span>
</p>
<p class="stanza">
Here, in the quiet earth, they laid apart<br />
<span class="i2">No man of iron mould and bloody hands,</span>
Who sought to wreck upon the cowering lands<br />
<span class="i2">The passions that consumed his restless heart:</span>
But one of tender spirit and delicate frame,<br />
<span class="i6">Gentlest in mien and mind,</span>
<span class="i6">Of gentle womankind,</span>
Timidly shrinking from the breath of blame;<br />
One in whose eyes the smile of kindness made<br />
<span class="i2">Its haunt, like flowers by sunny brooks in May,</span>
Yet, at the thought of others' pain, a shade<br />
<span class="i2">Of sweeter sadness chased the smile away.</span>
</p>
<p class="stanza">Nor deem that when the hand that molders here<br />
Was raised in menace, realms were chilled with fear,<br />
<span class="i2">And armies mustered at the sign, as when</span>
Clouds rise on clouds before the rainy East,<br />
<span class="i2">Gray captains leading bands of veteran men</span>
And fiery youths to be the vulture's feast.<br />
Not thus were raged the mighty wars that gave<br />
The victory to her who fills this grave;<br />
<span class="i6">Alone her task was wrought,</span>
<span class="i6">Alone the battle fought;</span>
Through that long strife her constant hope was staid<br />
<span class="i2">On God alone, nor looked for other aid.</span>
</p>
<p class="stanza">
She met the hosts of sorrow with a look<br />
<span class="i2">That altered not beneath the frown they wore,</span>
<a name="Page_444"></a>And soon the lowering brood were tamed, and took,<br />
<span class="i2">Meekly, her gentle rule, and frowned no more.</span>
Her soft hand put aside the assaults of wrath,<br />
<span class="i6">And calmly broke in twain</span>
<span class="i6">The fiery shafts of pain,</span>
And rent the nets of passion from her path.<br />
<span class="i2">By that victorious hand despair was slain.</span>
With love she vanquished hate and overcame<br />
Evil with good, in her Great Master's name.
</p>
<p class="stanza">
Her glory is not of this shadowy state,<br />
<span class="i2">Glory that with the fleeting season dies;</span>
But when she entered at the sapphire gate<br />
<span class="i2">What joy was radiant in celestial eyes!</span>
How heaven's bright depths with sounding welcomes rung,<br />
And flowers of heaven by shining hands were flung!<br />
<span class="i6">And He who, long before,</span>
<span class="i6">Pain, scorn, and sorrow bore,</span>
The Mighty Sufferer, with aspect sweet,<br />
Smiled on the timid stranger from his seat;<br />
He who returning, glorious, from the grave,<br />
Dragged Death, disarmed, in chains, a crouching slave.
</p>
<p class="stanza">
See, as I linger here, the sun grows low;<br />
<span class="i2">Cool airs are murmuring that the night is near.</span>
Oh gentle sleeper, from thy grave I go<br />
<span class="i2">Consoled though sad, in hope and yet in fear.</span>
<span class="i6">Brief is the time, I know,</span>
<span class="i6">The warfare scarce begun;</span>
Yet all may win the triumphs thou hast won.<br />
<a name="Page_445"></a>Still flows the fount whose waters strengthened thee;<br />
<span class="i2">The victors' names are yet too few to fill</span>
Heaven's mighty roll; the glorious armory,<br />
<span class="i2">That ministered to thee, is open still.</span>

<p class="title"><a name="LYCIDAS"></a>LYCIDAS.</p>

<p class="stanza">Yet once more, O ye laurels, and once more<br />
Ye myrtles brown, with ivy never sere,<br />
I come to pluck your berries harsh and crude<br />
And with forced fingers rude<br />
Shatter your leaves before the mellowing year,<br />
Bitter constraint, and sad occasion dear,<br />
Compels me to disturb your season due;<br />
For Lycidas is dead, dead ere his prime,<br />
Young Lycidas, and hath not left his peer.<br />
Who would not sing for Lycidas? He knew<br />
Himself to sing, and build the lofty rhyme.<br />
He must not float upon his watery bier<br />
Unwept, and welter to the parching wind,<br />
Without the meed of some melodious tear.<br />
<span class="i2">Begin then, sisters of the sacred well,</span>
That from beneath the seat of Jove doth spring,<br />
Begin, and somewhat loudly sweep the string.<br />
Hence with denial vain, and coy excuse;<br />
So may some gentle muse<br />
With lucky words favor my destined urn,<br />
<a name="Page_447"></a>And as he passes turn,<br />
And bid fair peace be to my sable shroud;<br />
For we were nursed upon the self-same hill,<br />
Fed the same flock by fountain, shade, and rill.<br />
Together both, ere the high lawns appeared<br />
Under the opening eyelids of the morn,<br />
We drove a-field, and both together heard<br />
What time the gray-fly winds her sultry horn,<br />
Battening our flocks with the fresh dews of night,<br />
Oft till the star that rose at evening bright<br />
Toward heaven's descent had sloped his westering wheel.<br />
Meanwhile the rural ditties were not mute,<br />
Tempered to the oaten flute;<br />
Rough satyrs danced, and fauns with cloven heel<br />
From the glad song would not be absent long,<br />
And old Damtas loved to hear our song.<br />
<span class="i2">But, oh, the heavy change, now thou art gone&mdash;</span>
Now thou art gone, and never must return!<br />
Thee, shepherd, thee the woods, and desert caves,<br />
With wild thyme and the gadding vine o'ergrown,<br />
And all their echoes, mourn;<br />
The willows, and the hazel copses green,<br />
Shall now no more be seen,<br />
Fanning their joyous leaves to thy soft lays.<br />
As killing as the canker to the rose,<br />
Or taint-worm to the weanling herds that graze,<br />
Or frost to flowers, that their gay wardrobe wear,<br />
When first the white-thorn blows;<br />
Such, Lycidas, thy loss to shepherd's ear.<br />
<span class="i2">Where were ye, nymphs, when the remorseless deep</span>
<a name="Page_448"></a>Closed o'er the head of your loved Lycidas?<br />
For neither were ye playing on the steep,<br />
Where your old bards, the famous druids, lie,<br />
Nor on the shaggy top of Mona high,<br />
Nor yet where Deva spreads her wizard stream&mdash;<br />
Ay me! I fondly dream,<br />
Had ye been there; for what could that have done?<br />
What could the muse herself that Orpheus bore,<br />
The muse herself for her enchanting son,<br />
Whom universal nature did lament,<br />
When, by the rout that made the hideous roar,<br />
His gory visage down the stream was sent,<br />
Down the swift Hebrus to the Lesbian shore?<br />
<span class="i2">Alas! what boots it with incessant care</span>
To tend the homely, slighted shepherd's trade,<br />
And strictly meditate the thankless muse?<br />
Were it not better done, as others use,<br />
To sport with Amaryllis in the shade,<br />
Or with the tangles of Neaera's hair?<br />
Fame is the spur that the clear spirit doth raise<br />
(That last infirmity of noble minds)<br />
To scorn delights, and live laborious days;<br />
But the fair guerdon when we hope to find,<br />
And think to burst out into sudden blaze,<br />
Comes the blind fury with the abhorred shears,<br />
And slits the thin-spun life. But not the praise,<br />
Phoebus replied, and touched my trembling ears;<br />
Fame is no plant that grows on mortal soil,<br />
Nor in the glistering foil<br />
Set off to the world, nor in broad rumor lies;<br />
But lives and spreads aloft by those pure eyes<br />
And perfect witness of all-judging Jove;<br />
<a name="Page_449"></a>As he pronounces lastly on each deed,<br />
Of so much fame in heaven expect thy meed.<br />
<span class="i2">O fountain Arethuse, and thou honored flood,</span>
Smooth-sliding Mincius, crowned with vocal reeds,<br />
That strain I heard was of a higher mood;<br />
But now my oat proceeds,<br />
And listens to the herald of the sea<br />
That came in Neptune's plea;<br />
He asked the waves, and asked the felon winds,<br />
What hard mishap hath doomed this gentle swain?<br />
And questioned every gust of rugged winds<br />
That blows from off each beak&egrave;d promontory;<br />
They knew not of his story;<br />
And sage Hippotades their answer brings,<br />
That not a blast was from his dungeon strayed;<br />
The air was calm, and on the level brine<br />
Sleek Panop&egrave; with all her sisters played.<br />
It was that fatal and perfidious bark,<br />
Built in th' eclipse, and rigged with curses dark,<br />
That sunk so low that sacred head of thine.<br />
<span class="i2">Next Camus, reverend sire, went footing slow,</span>
His mantle hairy, and his bonnet sedge,<br />
Inwrought with figures dim, and on the edge,<br />
Like to that sanguine flower, inscribed with woe.<br />
Ah! who hath reft (quoth he) my dearest pledge?<br />
Last came, and last did go,<br />
The pilot of the Galilean Lake;<br />
Two massy keys he bore of metals twain<br />
(The golden opes, the iron shuts amain);<br />
He shook his mitred locks, and stern bespake:<br />
How well could I have spared for thee, young swain,<br />
Enow of such as for their bellies' sake<br />
<a name="Page_450"></a>Creep, and intrude, and climb into the fold?<br />
Of other care they little reckoning make,<br />
Than how to scramble at the shearers' feast,<br />
And shove away the worthy bidden guest;<br />
Blind mouths! that scarce themselves know how to hold<br />
A sheep-hook, or have learned aught else the least<br />
That to the faithful herdsman's art belongs!<br />
What recks it them? what need they? they are sped;<br />
And when they list, their lean and flashy songs<br />
Grate on their scrannel pipes of wretched straw;<br />
The hungry sheep look up, and are not fed,<br />
But, swollen with wind and the rank mist they draw,<br />
Rot inwardly, and foul contagion spread;<br />
Besides what the grim wolf with privy paw<br />
Daily devours apace, and nothing said;<br />
But that two-handed engine at the door,<br />
Stands ready to smite once, and smite no more.<br />
<span class="i2">Return, Alpheus, the dread voice is past,</span>
That shrunk thy streams; return, Sicilian muse,<br />
And call the vales, and bid them hither cast<br />
Their bells, and flowerets of a thousand hues.<br />
Ye valleys low, where the mild whispers use<br />
Of shades, and wanton winds, and gushing brooks,<br />
On whose fresh lap the swart-star sparely looks,<br />
Throw hither all your quaint enamelled eyes,<br />
That on the green turf suck the honeyed showers,<br />
And purple all the ground with vernal flowers.<br />
Bring the rathe primrose that forsaken dies,<br />
The tufted crow-toe, and pale jessamine,<br />
The white pink, and the pansy freaked with jet,<br />
<a name="Page_451"></a>The glowing violet,<br />
The musk-rose, and the well-attired woodbine,<br />
With cowslips wan that hang the pensive head,<br />
And every flower that sad embroidery wears.<br />
Bid Amaranthus all his beauty shed,<br />
And daffodillies fill their cups with tears,<br />
To strew the laureat hearse where Lycid lies,<br />
For so to interpose a little ease,<br />
Let our frail thoughts dally with false surmise.<br />
Ay me! whilst thee the shores and sounding seas<br />
Wash far away where'er thy bones are hurled,<br />
Whether beyond the stormy Hebrides,<br />
Where thou perhaps under the whelming tide<br />
Visit'st the bottom of the monstrous world;<br />
Or whether thou to our moist vows denied,<br />
Sleep'st by the fable of Bellerus old,<br />
Where the great vision of the guarded mount<br />
Looks towards Namancos and Bayona's hold;<br />
Look homeward angel now, and melt with ruth!<br />
And, O ye dolphins, waft the hapless youth!<br />
<span class="i2">Weep no more, woful shepherds, weep no more!</span>
For Lycidas your sorrow is not dead,<br />
Sunk though he be beneath the watery floor.<br />
So sinks the day-star in the ocean bed,<br />
And yet anon repairs his drooping head,<br />
And tricks his beams, and with new-spangled ore<br />
Flames in the forehead of the morning sky;<br />
So Lycidas sunk low, but mounted high,<br />
Through the dear might of Him that walked the waves,<br />
Where, other groves and other streams along,<br />
With nectar pure his oozy locks he laves,<br />
And hears the unexpressive nuptial song,<br />
<a name="Page_452"></a>In the blest kingdoms meek of joy and love.<br />
There entertain him all the saints above,<br />
In solemn troops and sweet societies,<br />
That sing, and singing in their glory move,<br />
And wipe the tears forever from his eyes.<br />
Now, Lycidas, the shepherds weep no more;<br />
Henceforth thou art the genius of the shore,<br />
In thy large recompense, and shalt be good<br />
To all that wander in that perilous flood.<br />
<span class="i2">Thus sang the uncouth swain to th' oaks and rills,</span>
While the still morn went out with sandals gray;<br />
He touched the tender stops of various quills,<br />
With eager thought warbling his Doric lay.<br />
And now the sun had stretched out all the hills,<br />
And now was dropt into the western bay;<br />
At last he rose, and twitched his mantle blue:<br />
To-morrow to fresh, woods and pastures new.

<p class="title"><a name="BLIND"></a>BLIND.</p>

<p class="stanza">Laughing, the blind boys<br />
Run 'round their college lawn,<br />
Playing such games of buff<br />
Over its dappled grass!
</p>
<p class="stanza">See the blind frolicsome<br />
Girls in blue pinafores,<br />
Turning their skipping ropes!
</p>
<p class="stanza">How full and rich a world<br />
Theirs to inhabit is!<br />
Sweet scent of grass and bloom,<br />
Playmates' glad symphony.<br />
Cool touch of western wind,<br />
Sunshine's divine caress.<br />
How should they know or feel<br />
They are in darkness?
</p>
<p class="stanza">But&mdash;O the miracle!<br />
If a Redeemer came,<br />
Laid fingers on their eyes&mdash;<br />
One touch&mdash;and what a world<br />
New born in loveliness!
</p>
<p class="stanza">Spaces of green and sky,<br />
Hulls of white cloud adrift,<br />
<a name="Page_461"></a>Ivy-grown college walls,<br />
Shining loved faces!
</p>
<p class="stanza">What a dark world&mdash;who knows?<br />
Ours to inhabit is!<br />
One touch, and what a strange<br />
Glory might burst on us!<br />
What a hid universe!
</p>
<p class="stanza">Do we sport carelessly,<br />
Blindly, upon the verge<br />
Of an Apocalypse?

<p class="title">THE DEATH OF DEATH.</p>

<p class="subt">SONNET CXLVI.</p>

<p class="stanza">Poor soul, the centre of my sinful earth,<br />
Fooled by those rebel powers that thee array,<br />
Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth,<br />
Painting thy outward walls so costly gay?<br />
Why so large cost, having so short a lease,<br />
Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend?<br />
Shall worms, inheritors of this excess,<br />
Eat up thy charge? Is this thy body's end?<br />
Then, soul, live thou upon thy servant's loss,<br />
And let that pine to aggravate thy store;<br />
Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross;<br />
Within be fed, without be rich no more.<br />
<span class="i2">So shalt thou feed on Death, that feeds on men,</span>
<span class="i2">And, Death once dead, there's no more dying then.</span>

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy

Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with

keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
